# Getting Started with the DITA Open Toolkit

Getting Started provides a guided exploration of the DITA Open Toolkit. It is geared for an audience that has little or no knowledge of build scripts or DITA-OT parameters. It walks the novice user through installing the toolkit and building output.

1.  [Installing the distribution package](installing-client.html)  
The DITA-OT distribution package can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It contains everything that you need to run the toolkit except for Java.
2.  [Building output using the dita command](first-build-using-dita-command.html)  
You can generate output using the DITA Open Toolkit dita command-line tool. Build parameters can be specified on the command line or with .properties files.
