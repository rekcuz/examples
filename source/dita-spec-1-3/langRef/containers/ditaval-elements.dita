<p>The DITAVAL format has several elements: <xmlelement>val</xmlelement>, the root element, can
                contain a <xmlelement>style-conflict</xmlelement> element followed by
                    <xmlelement>prop</xmlelement> or <xmlelement>revprop</xmlelement> elements; the
                    <xmlelement>prop</xmlelement> and <xmlelement>revprop</xmlelement> elements can
                contain <xmlelement>startflag</xmlelement> and <xmlelement>endflag</xmlelement>
                elements; and the <xmlelement>startflag</xmlelement> and
                    <xmlelement>endflag</xmlelement> elements can contain
                    <xmlelement>alt-text</xmlelement>
                elements.<!--<draft-comment>jeff ogden: wanted this in a new section of the spec rather than under common attributes. now done. Also questioned whether it was normative. Reviewed with TC, and confirmed: the ditaval format was not normative in 1.0, it is normative in 1.1. There was some old wording from 1.0 earlier that confused the issue, I've removed it.</draft-comment>--></p>

<section><title>Note on ditaval flagging of images</title><p>If an
image in DITA content becomes flagged using a background color, the
color should be represented as a thick border.  If a foreground color
is expressed, it should be represented as a  thin border.</p>
