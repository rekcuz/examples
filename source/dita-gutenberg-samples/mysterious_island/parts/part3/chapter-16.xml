        a magnificent head, the forehead high, the glance commanding, beard white, hair abundant and
        falling over the shoulders.</p><p>His hand rested upon the cushion of the divan from which he had just risen. He appeared
        perfectly calm. It was evident that his strength had been gradually undermined by illness,
        but his voice seemed yet powerful, as he said in English, and in a tone which evinced
        extreme surprise,--</p><p>"Sir, I have no name."</p><p>"Nevertheless, I know you!" replied Cyrus Harding.</p><p>Captain Nemo fixed his penetrating gaze upon the engineer, as though he were about to
        annihilate him.</p><p>Then, falling back amid the pillows of the divan,--</p><p>"After all, what matters now?" he murmured; "I am dying!"</p><p>Cyrus Harding drew near the captain, and Gideon Spilett took his hand--it was of a feverish
        heat. Ayrton, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb stood respectfully apart in an angle of the
        magnificent saloon, whose atmosphere was saturated with the electric fluid.</p><p>Meanwhile Captain Nemo withdrew his hand, and motioned the engineer and the reporter to be
        seated.</p><p>All regarded him with profound emotion. Before them they beheld that being whom they had
        styled the "genius of the island," the powerful protector whose intervention, in so many
        circumstances, had been so efficacious, the benefactor to whom they owed such a debt of
        gratitude! Their eyes beheld a man only, and a man at the point of death, where Pencroft and
        Neb had expected to find an almost supernatural being!</p><p>But how happened it that Cyrus Harding had recognized Captain Nemo? why had the latter so
        suddenly risen on hearing this name uttered, a name which he had believed known to
        none?--</p><p>The captain had resumed his position on the divan, and leaning on his arm, he regarded the
        engineer, seated near him.</p><p>"You know the name I formerly bore, sir?" he asked.</p><p>"I do," answered Cyrus Harding, "and also that of this wonderful submarine vessel--"</p><p>"The 'Nautilus'?" said the captain, with a faint smile.</p><p>"The 'Nautilus.'"</p><p>"But do you--do you know who I am?"</p><p>"I do."</p><p>"It is nevertheless many years since I have held any communication with the inhabited
        world; three long years have I passed in the depth of the sea, the only place where I have
        found liberty! Who then can have betrayed my secret?"</p><p>"A man who was bound to you by no tie, Captain Nemo, and who, consequently, cannot be
        accused of treachery."</p><p>"The Frenchman who was cast on board my vessel by chance sixteen years since?"</p><p>"The same."</p><p>"He and his two companions did not then perish in the maelstrom, in the midst of which the
        'Nautilus' was struggling?"</p><p>"They escaped, and a book has appeared under the title of 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under
        the Sea,' which contains your history."</p><p>"The history of a few months only of my life!" interrupted the captain impetuously.</p><p>"It is true," answered Cyrus Harding, "but a few months of that strange life have sufficed
        to make you known."</p><p>"As a great criminal, doubtless!" said Captain Nemo, a haughty smile curling his lips.
        "Yes, a rebel, perhaps an outlaw against humanity!"</p><p>The engineer was silent.</p><p>"Well, sir?"</p><p>"It is not for me to judge you, Captain Nemo," answered Cyrus Harding, "at any rate as
        regards your past life. I am, with the rest of the world, ignorant of the motives which
        induced you to adopt this strange mode of existence, and I cannot judge of effects without
        knowing their causes; but what I do know is, that a beneficent hand has constantly protected
        us since our arrival on Lincoln Island, that we all owe our lives to a good, generous, and
        powerful being, and that this being so powerful, good and generous, Captain Nemo, is
        yourself!"</p><p>"It is I," answered the captain simply.</p><p>The engineer and the reporter rose. Their companions had drawn near, and the gratitude with
        which their hearts were charged was about to express itself in their gestures and words.</p><p>Captain Nemo stopped them by a sign, and in a voice which betrayed more emotion than he
        doubtless intended to show.</p><p>"Wait till you have heard all," he said.</p><p>And the captain, in a few concise sentences, ran over the events of his life.</p><p>His narrative was short, yet he was obliged to summon up his whole remaining energy to
        arrive at the end. He was evidently contending against extreme weakness. Several times Cyrus
        Harding entreated him to repose for a while, but he shook his head as a man to whom the
        morrow may never come, and when the reporter offered his assistance,--</p><p>"It is useless," he said; "my hours are numbered."</p><p>Captain Nemo was an Indian, the Prince Dakkar, son of a rajah of the then independent
        territory of Bundelkund. His father sent him, when ten years of age, to Europe, in order
        that he might receive an education in all respects complete, and in the hopes that by his
        talents and knowledge he might one day take a leading part in raising his long degraded and
        heathen country to a level with the nations of Europe.</p><p>From the age of ten years to that of thirty Prince Dakkar, endowed by Nature with her
        richest gifts of intellect, accumulated knowledge of every kind, and in science, literature,
        and art his researches were extensive and profound.</p><p>He traveled over the whole of Europe. His rank and fortune caused him to be everywhere
        sought after; but the pleasures of the world had for him no attractions. Though young and
        possessed of every personal advantage, he was ever grave--somber even--devoured by an
        unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and cherishing in the recesses of his heart the hope that
        he might become a great and powerful ruler of a free and enlightened people.</p><p>Still, for long the love of science triumphed over all other feelings. He became an artist
        deeply impressed by the marvels of art, a philosopher to whom no one of the higher sciences
        was unknown, a statesman versed in the policy of European courts. To the eyes of those who
        observed him superficially he might have passed for one of those cosmopolitans, curious of
        knowledge, but disdaining action; one of those opulent travelers, haughty and cynical, who
        move incessantly from place to place, and are of no country.</p><p>The history of Captain Nemo has, in fact, been published under the title of "Twenty
        Thousand Leagues Under the Sea." Here, therefore, will apply the observation already made as
        to the adventures of Ayrton with regard to the discrepancy of dates. Readers should
        therefore refer to the note already published on this point.</p><p>This artist, this philosopher, this man was, however, still cherishing the hope instilled
        into him from his earliest days.</p><p>Prince Dakkar returned to Bundelkund in the year 1849. He married a noble Indian lady, who
        was imbued with an ambition not less ardent than that by which he was inspired. Two children
        were born to them, whom they tenderly loved. But domestic happiness did not prevent him from
        seeking to carry out the object at which he aimed. He waited an opportunity. At length, as
        he vainly fancied, it presented itself.</p><p>Instigated by princes equally ambitious and less sagacious and more unscrupulous than he
        was, the people of India were persuaded that they might successfully rise against their
        English rulers, who had brought them out of a state of anarchy and constant warfare and
        misery, and had established peace and prosperity in their country. Their ignorance and gross
        superstition made them the facile tools of their designing chiefs.</p><p>In 1857 the great sepoy revolt broke out. Prince Dakkar, under the belief that he should
        thereby have the opportunity of attaining the object of his long-cherished ambition, was
        easily drawn into it. He forthwith devoted his talents and wealth to the service of this
        cause. He aided it in person; he fought in the front ranks; he risked his life equally with
        the humblest of the wretched and misguided fanatics; he was ten times wounded in twenty
        engagements, seeking death but finding it not, but at length the sanguinary rebels were
        utterly defeated, and the atrocious mutiny was brought to an end.</p><p>Never before had the British power in India been exposed to such danger, and if, as they
        had hoped, the sepoys had received assistance from without, the influence and supremacy in
        Asia of the United Kingdom would have been a thing of the past.</p><p>The name of Prince Dakkar was at that time well known. He had fought openly and without
        concealment. A price was set upon his head, but he managed to escape from his pursuers.</p><p>Civilization never recedes; the law of necessity ever forces it onwards. The sepoys were
        vanquished, and the land of the rajahs of old fell again under the rule of England.</p><p>Prince Dakkar, unable to find that death he courted, returned to the mountain fastnesses of
        Bundelkund. There, alone in the world, overcome by disappointment at the destruction of all
        his vain hopes, a prey to profound disgust for all human beings, filled with hatred of the
        civilized world, he realized the wreck of his fortune, assembled some score of his most
        faithful companions, and one day disappeared, leaving no trace behind.</p><p>Where, then, did he seek that liberty denied him upon the inhabited earth? Under the waves,
        in the depths of the ocean, where none could follow.</p><p>The warrior became the man of science. Upon a deserted island of the Pacific he established
        his dockyard, and there a submarine vessel was constructed from his designs. By methods
        which will at some future day be revealed he had rendered subservient the illimitable forces
        of electricity, which, extracted from inexhaustible sources, was employed for all the
        requirements of his floating equipage, as a moving, lighting, and heating agent. The sea,
        with its countless treasures, its myriads of fish, its numberless wrecks, its enormous
        mammalia, and not only all that nature supplied, but also all that man had lost in its
        depths, sufficed for every want of the prince and his crew--and thus was his most ardent
        desire accomplished, never again to hold communication with the earth. He named his
        submarine vessel the "Nautilus," called himself simply Captain Nemo, and disappeared beneath
        the seas.</p><p>During many years this strange being visited every ocean, from pole to pole. Outcast of the
        inhabited earth in these unknown worlds he gathered incalculable treasures. The millions
        lost in the Bay of Vigo, in 1702, by the galleons of Spain, furnished him with a mine of
        inexhaustible riches which he devoted always, anonymously, in favor of those nations who
        fought for the independence of their country.</p><p> (This refers to the resurrection of the Candiotes, who were, in fact, largely assisted by
        Captain Nemo.)</p><p>For long, however, he had held no communication with his fellow- creatures, when, during
        the night of the 6th of November, 1866, three men were cast on board his vessel. They were a
        French professor, his servant, and a Canadian fisherman. These three men had been hurled
        overboard by a collision which had taken place between the "Nautilus" and the United States
        frigate "Abraham Lincoln," which had chased her.</p><p>Captain Nemo learned from this professor that the "Nautilus," taken now for a gigantic
        mammal of the whale species, now for a submarine vessel carrying a crew of pirates, was
        sought for in every sea.</p><p>He might have returned these three men to the ocean, from whence chance had brought them in
        contact with his mysterious existence. Instead of doing this he kept them prisoners, and
        during seven months they were enabled to behold all the wonders of a voyage of twenty
        thousand leagues under the sea.</p><p>One day, the 22nd of June, 1867, these three men, who knew nothing of the past history of
        Captain Nemo, succeeded in escaping in one of the "Nautilus's" boats. But as at this time
        the "Nautilus" was drawn into the vortex of the maelstrom, off the coast of Norway, the
        captain naturally believed that the fugitives, engulfed in that frightful whirlpool, found
        their death at the bottom of the abyss. He was unaware that the Frenchman and his two
        companions had been miraculously cast on shore, that the fishermen of the Lofoten Islands
        had rendered them assistance, and that the professor, on his return to France, had published
        that work in which seven months of the strange and eventful navigation of the "Nautilus"
        were narrated and exposed to the curiosity of the public.</p><p>For a long time alter this, Captain Nemo continued to live thus, traversing every sea. But
        one by one his companions died, and found their last resting-place in their cemetery of
        coral, in the bed of the Pacific. At last Captain Nemo remained the solitary survivor of all
        those who had taken refuge with him in the depths of the ocean.</p><p>He was now sixty years of age. Although alone, he succeeded in navigating the "Nautilus"
        towards one of those submarine caverns which had sometimes served him as a harbor.</p><p>One of these ports was hollowed beneath Lincoln Island, and at this moment furnished an
        asylum to the "Nautilus."</p><p>The captain had now remained there six years, navigating the ocean no longer, but awaiting
        death, and that moment when he should rejoin his former companions, when by chance he
        observed the descent of the balloon which carried the prisoners of the Confederates. Clad in
        his diving dress he was walking beneath the water at a few cables' length from the shore of
        the island, when the engineer had been thrown into the sea. Moved by a feeling of compassion
        the captain saved Cyrus Harding.</p><p>His first impulse was to fly from the vicinity of the five castaways; but his harbor refuge
        was closed, for in consequence of an elevation of the basalt, produced by the influence of
        volcanic action, he could no longer pass through the entrance of the vault. Though there was
        sufficient depth of water to allow a light craft to pass the bar, there was not enough for
        the "Nautilus," whose draught of water was considerable.</p><p>Captain Nemo was compelled, therefore, to remain. He observed these men thrown without
        resources upon a desert island, but had no wish to be himself discovered by them. By degrees
        he became interested in their efforts when he saw them honest, energetic, and bound to each
        other by the ties of friendship. As if despite his wishes, he penetrated all the secrets of
        their existence. By means of the diving dress he could easily reach the well in the interior
        of Granite House, and climbing by the projections of rock to its upper orifice he heard the
        colonists as they recounted the past, and studied the present and future. He learned from
        them the tremendous conflict of America with America itself, for the abolition of slavery.
        Yes, these men were worthy to reconcile Captain Nemo with that humanity which they
        represented so nobly in the island.</p><p>Captain Nemo had saved Cyrus Harding. It was he also who had brought back the dog to the
        Chimneys, who rescued Top from the waters of the lake, who caused to fall at Flotsam Point
        the case containing so many things useful to the colonists, who conveyed the canoe back into
        the stream of the Mercy, who cast the cord from the top of Granite House at the time of the
        attack by the baboons, who made known the presence of Ayrton upon Tabor Island, by means of
        the document enclosed in the bottle, who caused the explosion of the brig by the shock of a
        torpedo placed at the bottom of the canal, who saved Herbert from certain death by bringing
        the sulphate of quinine; and finally, it was he who had killed the convicts with the
        electric balls, of which he possessed the secret, and which he employed in the chase of
        submarine creatures. Thus were explained so many apparently supernatural occurrences, and
        which all proved the generosity and power of the captain.</p><p>Nevertheless, this noble misanthrope longed to benefit his proteges still further. There
        yet remained much useful advice to give them, and, his heart being softened by the approach
        of death, he invited, as we are aware, the colonists of Granite House to visit the
        "Nautilus," by means of a wire which connected it with the corral. Possibly he would not
        have done this had he been aware that Cyrus Harding was sufficiently acquainted with his
        history to address him by the name of Nemo.</p><p>The captain concluded the narrative of his life. Cyrus Harding then spoke; he recalled all
        the incidents which had exercised so beneficent an influence upon the colony, and in the
        names of his companions and himself thanked the generous being to whom they owed so
        much.</p><p>But Captain Nemo paid little attention; his mind appeared to be absorbed by one idea, and
        without taking the proffered hand of the engineer,--</p><p>"Now, sir," said he, "now that you know my history, your judgment!"</p><p>In saying this, the captain evidently alluded to an important incident witnessed by the
        three strangers thrown on board his vessel, and which the French professor had related in
        his work, causing a profound and terrible sensation. Some days previous to the flight of the
        professor and his two companions, the "Nautilus," being chased by a frigate in the north of
        the Atlantic had hurled herself as a ram upon this frigate, and sunk her without mercy.</p><p>Cyrus Harding understood the captain's allusion, and was silent.</p><p>"It was an enemy's frigate," exclaimed Captain Nemo, transformed for an instant into the
        Prince Dakkar, "an enemy's frigate! It was she who attacked me--I was in a narrow and
        shallow bay--the frigate barred my way-- and I sank her!"</p><p>A few moments of silence ensued; then the captain demanded,--</p><p>"What think you of my life, gentlemen?"</p><p>Cyrus Harding extended his hand to the ci-devant prince and replied gravely, "Sir, your
        error was in supposing that the past can be resuscitated, and in contending against
        inevitable progress. It is one of those errors which some admire, others blame; which God
        alone can judge. He who is mistaken in an action which he sincerely believes to be right may
        be an enemy, but retains our esteem. Your error is one that we may admire, and your name has
        nothing to fear from the judgment of history, which does not condemn heroic folly, but its
        results."</p><p>The old man's breast swelled with emotion, and raising his hand to heaven,--</p><p>"Was I wrong, or in the right?" he murmured.</p><p>Cyrus Harding replied, "All great actions return to God, from whom they are derived.
        Captain Nemo, we, whom you have succored, shall ever mourn your loss."</p><p>Herbert, who had drawn near the captain, fell on his knees and kissed his hand.</p><p>A tear glistened in the eyes of the dying man. "My child," he said, "may God bless
        you!"</p><p/></body></topic>
