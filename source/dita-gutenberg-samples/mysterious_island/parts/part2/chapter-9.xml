<topic  id="p2-chapter-9" ><title>Chapter 9</title><body><p>The weather changed during the first week of March. There had been a full moon at the
        commencement of the month, and the heat was excessive. The atmosphere was felt to be full of
        electricity, and a period of some length of tempestuous weather was to be feared.</p><p>Indeed, on the 2nd, peals of thunder were heard, the wind blew from the east, and hail
        rattled against the facade of Granite House like volleys of grape-shot. The door and windows
        were immediately closed, or everything in the rooms would have been drenched. On seeing
        these hailstones, some of which were the size of a pigeon's egg, Pencroft's first thought
        was that his cornfield was in serious danger.</p><p>He directly rushed to his field, where little green heads were already appearing, and by
        means of a great cloth, he managed to protect his crop.</p><p>This bad weather lasted a week, during which time the thunder rolled without cessation in
        the depths of the sky.</p><p>The colonists, not having any pressing work out of doors, profited by the bad weather to
        work at the interior of Granite House, the arrangement of which was becoming more complete
        from day to day. The engineer made a turning-lathe, with which he turned several articles
        both for the toilet and the kitchen, particularly buttons, the want of which was greatly
        felt. A gunrack had been made for the firearms, which were kept with extreme care, and
        neither tables nor cupboards were left incomplete. They sawed, they planed, they filed, they
        turned; and during the whole of this bad season, nothing was heard but the grinding of tools
        or the humming of the turning-lathe which responded to the growling of the thunder.</p><p>Master Jup had not been forgotten, and he occupied a room at the back, near the storeroom,
        a sort of cabin with a cot always full of good litter, which perfectly suited his taste.</p><p>"With good old Jup there is never any quarreling," often repeated Pencroft, "never any
        improper reply. What a servant, Neb, what a servant!"</p><p>Of course Jup was now well used to service. He brushed their clothes, he turned the spit,
        he waited at table, he swept the rooms, he gathered wood, and he performed another admirable
        piece of service which delighted Pencroft--he never went to sleep without first coming to
        tuck up the worthy sailor in his bed.</p><p>As to the health of the members of the colony, bipeds or bimana, quadrumana or quadrupeds,
        it left nothing to be desired. With their life in the open air, on this salubrious soil,
        under that temperate zone, working both with head and hands, they could not suppose that
        illness would ever attack them.</p><p>All were indeed wonderfully well. Herbert had already grown two inches in the year. His
        figure was forming and becoming more manly, and he promised to be an accomplished man,
        physically as well as morally. Besides he improved himself during the leisure hours which
        manual occupations left to him; he read the books found in the case; and after the practical
        lessons which were taught by the very necessity of their position, he found in the engineer
        for science, and the reporter for languages, masters who were delighted to complete his
        education.</p><p>The tempest ended about the 9th of March, but the sky remained covered with clouds during
        the whole of this last summer month. The atmosphere, violently agitated by the electric
        commotions, could not recover its former purity, and there was almost invariably rain and
        fog, except for three or four fine days on which several excursions were made. About this
        time the female onager gave birth to a young one which belonged to the same sex as its
        mother, and which throve capitally. In the corral, the flock of musmons had also increased,
        and several lambs already bleated in the sheds, to the great delight of Neb and Herbert, who
        had each their favorite among these newcomers. An attempt was also made for the
        domestication of the peccaries, which succeeded well. A sty was constructed under the
        poultry-yard, and soon contained several young ones in the way to become civilized, that is
        to say, to become fat under Neb's care. Master Jup, entrusted with carrying them their daily
        nourishment, leavings from the kitchen, etc., acquitted himself conscientiously of his task.
        He sometimes amused himself at the expense of his little pensioners by tweaking their tails;
        but this was mischief, and not wickedness, for these little twisted tails amused him like a
        plaything, and his instinct was that of a child. One day in this month of March, Pencroft,
        talking to the engineer, reminded Cyrus Harding of a promise which the latter had not as yet
        had time to fulfil.</p><p>"You once spoke of an apparatus which would take the place of the long ladders at Granite
        House, captain," said he; "won't you make it some day?"</p><p>"Nothing will be easier; but is this a really useful thing?"</p><p>"Certainly, captain. After we have given ourselves necessaries, let us think a little of
        luxury. For us it may be luxury, if you like, but for things it is necessary. It isn't very
        convenient to climb up a long ladder when one is heavily loaded."</p><p>"Well, Pencroft, we will try to please you," replied Cyrus Harding.</p><p>"But you have no machine at your disposal."</p><p>"We will make one."</p><p>"A steam machine?"</p><p>"No, a water machine."</p><p>And, indeed, to work his apparatus there was already a natural force at the disposal of the
        engineer which could be used without great difficulty. For this, it was enough to augment
        the flow of the little stream which supplied the interior of Granite House with water. The
        opening among the stones and grass was then increased, thus producing a strong fall at the
        bottom of the passage, the overflow from which escaped by the inner well. Below this fall
        the engineer fixed a cylinder with paddles, which was joined on the exterior with a strong
        cable rolled on a wheel, supporting a basket. In this way, by means of a long rope reaching
        to the ground, which enabled them to regulate the motive power, they could rise in the
        basket to the door of Granite House.</p><p>It was on the 17th of March that the lift acted for the first time, and gave universal
        satisfaction. Henceforward all the loads, wood, coal, provisions, and even the settlers
        themselves, were hoisted by this simple system, which replaced the primitive ladder, and, as
        may be supposed, no one thought of regretting the change. Top particularly was enchanted
        with this improvement, for he had not, and never could have possessed Master Jup's skill in
        climbing ladders, and often it was on Neb's back, or even on that of the orang that he had
        been obliged to make the ascent to Granite House. About this time, too, Cyrus Harding
        attempted to manufacture glass, and he at first put the old pottery-kiln to this new use.
        There were some difficulties to be encountered; but, after several fruitless attempts, he
        succeeded in setting up a glass manufactory, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert, his usual
        assistants, did not leave for several days. As to the substances used in the composition of
        glass, they are simply sand, chalk, and soda, either carbonate or sulphate. Now the beach
        supplied sand, lime supplied chalk, sea-weeds supplied soda, pyrites supplied sulphuric
        acid, and the ground supplied coal to heat the kiln to the wished-for temperature. Cyrus
        Harding thus soon had everything ready for setting to work.</p><p>The tool, the manufacture of which presented the most difficulty, was the pipe of the
        glass-maker, an iron tube, five or six feet long, which collects on one end the material in
        a state of fusion. But by means of a long, thin piece of iron rolled up like the barrel of a
        gun, Pencroft succeeded in making a tube soon ready for use.</p><p>On the 28th of March the tube was heated. A hundred parts of sand, thirty-five of chalk,
        forty of sulphate of soda, mixed with two or three parts of powdered coal, composed the
        substance, which was placed in crucibles. When the high temperature of the oven had reduced
        it to a liquid, or rather a pasty state, Cyrus Harding collected with the tube a quantity of
        the paste: he turned it about on a metal plate, previously arranged, so as to give it a form
        suitable for blowing, then he passed the tube to Herbert, telling him to blow at the other
        extremity.</p><p>And Herbert, swelling out his cheeks, blew so much and so well into the tube-taking care to
        twirl it round at the same time--that his breath dilated the glassy mass. Other quantities
        of the substance in a state of fusion were added to the first, and in a short time the
        result was a bubble which measured a foot in diameter. Harding then took the tube out of
        Herbert's hands, and, giving it a pendulous motion, he ended by lengthening the malleable
        bubble so as to give it a cylindroconic shape.</p><p>The blowing operation had given a cylinder of glass terminated by two hemispheric caps,
        which were easily detached by means of a sharp iron dipped in cold water; then, by the same
        proceeding, this cylinder was cut lengthways, and after having been rendered malleable by a
        second heating, it was extended on a plate and spread out with a wooden roller.</p><p>The first pane was thus manufactured, and they had only to perform this operation fifty
        times to have fifty panes. The windows at Granite House were soon furnished with panes; not
        very white, perhaps, but still sufficiently transparent.</p><p>As to bottles and tumblers, that was only play. They were satisfied with them, besides,
        just as they came from the end of the tube. Pencroft had asked to be allowed to "blow" in
        his turn, and it was great fun for him; but he blew so hard that his productions took the
        most ridiculous shapes, which he admired immensely.</p><p>Cyrus Harding and Herbert, while hunting one day, had entered the forest of the Far West,
        on the left bank of the Mercy, and, as usual, the lad was asking a thousand questions of the
        engineer, who answered them heartily. Now, as Harding was not a sportsman, and as, on the
        other side, Herbert was talking chemistry and natural philosophy, numbers of kangaroos,
        capybaras, and agouties came within range, which, however, escaped the lad's gun; the
        consequence was that the day was already advanced, and the two hunters were in danger of
        having made a useless excursion, when Herbert, stopping, and uttering a cry of joy,
        exclaimed,--</p><p>"Oh, Captain Harding, do you see that tree?" and he pointed to a shrub, rather than a tree,
        for it was composed of a single stem, covered with a scaly bark, which bore leaves streaked
        with little parallel veins.</p><p>"And what is this tree which resembles a little palm?" asked Harding.</p><p>"It is a 'cycas revoluta,' of which I have a picture in our dictionary of Natural History!"
        said Herbert.</p><p>"But I can't see any fruit on this shrub!" observed his companion.</p><p>"No, captain," replied Herbert; "but its stem contains a flour with which nature has
        provided us all ready ground."</p><p>"It is, then, the bread-tree?"</p><p>"Yes, the bread-tree."</p><p>"Well, my boy," replied the engineer, "this is a valuable discovery, since our wheat
        harvest is not yet ripe; I hope that you are not mistaken!"</p><p>Herbert was not mistaken: he broke the stem of a cycas, which was composed of a glandulous
        tissue, containing a quantity of floury pith, traversed with woody fiber, separated by rings
        of the same substance, arranged concentrically. With this fecula was mingled a mucilaginous
        juice of disagreeable flavor, but which it would be easy to get rid of by pressure. This
        cellular substance was regular flour of a superior quality, extremely nourishing; its
        exportation was formerly forbidden by the Japanese laws.</p><p>Cyrus Harding and Herbert, after having examined that part of the Far West where the cycas
        grew, took their bearings, and returned to Granite House, where they made known their
        discovery.</p><p>The next day the settlers went to collect some, and returned to Granite House with an ample
        supply of cycas stems. The engineer constructed a press, with which to extract the
        mucilaginous juice mingled with the fecula, and he obtained a large quantity of flour, which
        Neb soon transformed into cakes and puddings. This was not quite real wheaten bread, but it
        was very like it.</p><p>Now, too, the onager, the goats, and the sheep in the corral furnished daily the milk
        necessary to the colony. The cart, or rather a sort of light carriole which had replaced it,
        made frequent journeys to the corral, and when it was Pencroft's turn to go he took Jup, and
        let him drive, and Jup, cracking his whip, acquitted himself with his customary
        intelligence.</p><p>Everything prospered, as well in the corral as in Granite House, and certainly the
        settlers, if it had not been that they were so far from their native land, had no reason to
        complain. They were so well suited to this life, and were, besides, so accustomed to the
        island, that they could not have left its hospitable soil without regret!</p><p>And yet so deeply is the love of his country implanted in the heart of man, that if a ship
        had unexpectedly come in sight of the island, the colonists would have made signals, would
        have attracted her attention, and would have departed!</p><p>It was the 1st of April, a Sunday, Easter Day, which Harding and his companions sanctified
        by rest and prayer. The day was fine, such as an October day in the Northern Hemisphere
        might be.</p><p>All, towards the evening after dinner, were seated under the veranda on the edge of
        Prospect Heights, and they were watching the darkness creeping up from the horizon. Some
        cups of the infusion of elder-berries, which took the place of coffee, had been served by
        Neb. They were speaking of the island and of its isolated situation in the Pacific, which
        led Gideon Spilett to say,--</p><p>"My dear Cyrus, have you ever, since you possessed the sextant found in the case, again
        taken the position of our island?"</p><p>"No," replied the engineer.</p><p>"But it would perhaps be a good thing to do it with this instrument, which is more perfect
        than that which you before used."</p><p>"What is the good?" said Pencroft. "The island is quite comfortable where it is!"</p><p>"Well, who knows," returned the reporter, "who knows but that we may be much nearer
        inhabited land than we think?"</p><p>"We shall know to-morrow," replied Cyrus Harding, "and if it had not been for the
        occupations which left me no leisure, we should have known it already."</p><p>"Good!" said Pencroft. "The captain is too good an observer to be mistaken, and, if it has
        not moved from its place, the island is just where he put it."</p><p>"We shall see."</p><p>On the next day, therefore, by means of the sextant, the engineer made the necessary
        observations to verify the position which he had already obtained, and this was the result
        of his operation. His first observation had given him the situation of Lincoln Island,--</p><p> In west longitude: from 1500 to 1550;</p><p>In south latitude: from 300 to 350</p><p> The second gave exactly:</p><p> In longitude: 1500 30'</p><p>In south latitude: 340 57'</p><p>So then, notwithstanding the imperfection of his apparatus, Cyrus Harding had operated with
        so much skill that his error did not exceed five degrees.</p><p>"Now," said Gideon Spilett, "since we possess an atlas as well as a sextant, let us see, my
        dear Cyrus, the exact position which Lincoln Island occupies in the Pacific."</p><p>Herbert fetched the atlas, and the map of the Pacific was opened, and the engineer, compass
        in hand, prepared to determine their position.</p><p>Suddenly the compasses stopped, and he exclaimed,</p><p>"But an island exists in this part of the Pacific already!"</p><p>"An island?" cried Pencroft.</p><p>"Tabor Island."</p><p>"An important island?"</p><p>"No, an islet lost in the Pacific, and which perhaps has never been visited."</p><p>"Well, we will visit it," said Pencroft.</p><p>"We?"</p><p>"Yes, captain. We will build a decked boat, and I will undertake to steer her. At what
        distance are we from this Tabor Island?"</p><p>"About a hundred and fifty miles to the northeast," replied Harding.</p><p>"A hundred and fifty miles! And what's that?" returned Pencroft. "In forty-eight hours,
        with a good wind, we should sight it!"</p><p>And, on this reply, it was decided that a vessel should be constructed in time to be
        launched towards the month of next October, on the return of the fine season.</p><p/></body></topic>
