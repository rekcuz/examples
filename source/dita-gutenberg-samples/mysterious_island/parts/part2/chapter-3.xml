        which recent events had rendered so necessary. In fact, things had so come about that the
        settlers in Lincoln Island no longer needed help for themselves, but were even able to carry
        it to others.</p><p>It was therefore agreed that they should ascend the Mercy as far as the river was
        navigable. A great part of the distance would thus be traversed without fatigue, and the
        explorers could transport their provisions and arms to an advanced point in the west of the
        island.</p><p>It was necessary to think not only of the things which they should take with them, but also
        of those which they might have by chance to bring back to Granite House. If there had been a
        wreck on the coast, as was supposed, there would be many things cast up, which would be
        lawfully their prizes. In the event of this, the cart would have been of more use than the
        light canoe, but it was heavy and clumsy to drag, and therefore more difficult to use; this
        led Pencroft to express his regret that the chest had not contained, besides "his halfpound
        of tobacco," a pair of strong New Jersey horses, which would have been very useful to the
        colony!</p><p>The provisions, which Neb had already packed up, consisted of a store of meat and of
        several gallons of beer, that is to say enough to sustain them for three days, the time
        which Harding assigned for the expedition. They hoped besides to supply themselves on the
        road, and Neb took care not to forget the portable stove.</p><p>The only tools the settlers took were the two woodmen's axes, which they could use to cut a
        path through the thick forests, as also the instruments, the telescope and
        pocket-compass.</p><p>For weapons they selected the two flint-lock guns, which were likely to be more useful to
        them than the percussion fowling-pieces, the first only requiring flints which could be
        easily replaced, and the latter needing fulminating caps, a frequent use of which would soon
        exhaust their limited stock. However, they took also one of the carbines and some
        cartridges. As to the powder, of which there was about fifty pounds in the barrel, a small
        supply of it had to be taken, but the engineer hoped to manufacture an explosive substance
        which would allow them to husband it. To the firearms were added the five cutlasses well
        sheathed in leather, and, thus supplied, the settlers could venture into the vast forest
        with some chance of success.</p><p>It is useless to add that Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb, thus armed, were at the summit of
        their happiness, although Cyrus Harding made them promise not to fire a shot unless it was
        necessary.</p><p>At six in the morning the canoe put off from the shore; all had embarked, including Top,
        and they proceeded to the mouth of the Mercy.</p><p>The tide had begun to come up half an hour before. For several hours, therefore, there
        would be a current, which it was well to profit by, for later the ebb would make it
        difficult to ascend the river. The tide was already strong, for in three days the moon would
        be full, and it was enough to keep the boat in the center of the current, where it floated
        swiftly along between the high banks without its being necessary to increase its speed by
        the aid of the oars. In a few minutes the explorers arrived at the angle formed by the Mercy
        and exactly at the place where, seven months before, Pencroft had made his first raft of
        wood.</p><p>After this sudden angle the river widened and flowed under the shade of great evergreen
        firs.</p><p>The aspect of the banks was magnificent. Cyrus Harding and his companions could not but
        admire the lovely effects so easily produced by nature with water and trees. As they
        advanced the forest element diminished. On the right bank of the river grew magnificent
        specimens of the ulmaceae tribe, the precious elm, so valuable to builders, and which
        withstands well the action of water. Then there were numerous groups belonging to the same
        family, among others one in particular, the fruit of which produces a very useful oil.
        Further on, Herbert remarked the lardizabala, a twining shrub which, when bruised in water,
        furnishes excellent cordage; and two or three ebony trees of a beautiful black, crossed with
        capricious veins.</p><p>From time to time, in certain places where the landing was easy, the canoe was stopped,
        when Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft, their guns in their hands, and preceded by Top,
        jumped on shore. Without expecting game, some useful plant might be met with, and the young
        naturalist was delighted with discovering a sort of wild spinach, belonging to the order of
        chenopodiaceae, and numerous specimens of cruciferae, belonging to the cabbage tribe, which
        it would certainly be possible to cultivate by transplanting. There were cresses,
        horseradish, turnips, and lastly, little branching hairy stalks, scarcely more than three
        feet high, which produced brownish grains.</p><p>"Do you know what this plant is?" asked Herbert of the sailor.</p><p>"Tobacco!" cried Pencroft, who evidently had never seen his favorite plant except in the
        bowl of his pipe.</p><p>"No, Pencroft," replied Herbert; "this is not tobacco, it is mustard."</p><p>"Mustard be hanged!" returned the sailor; "but if by chance you happen to come across a
        tobacco-plant, my boy, pray don't scorn that!"</p><p>"We shall find it some day!" said Gideon Spilett.</p><p>"Well!" exclaimed Pencroft, "when that day comes, I do not know what more will be wanting
        in our island!"</p><p>These different plants, which had been carefully rooted up, were carried to the canoe,
        where Cyrus Harding had remained buried in thought.</p><p>The reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft in this manner frequently disembarked, sometimes on the
        right bank, sometimes on the left bank of the Mercy.</p><p>The latter was less abrupt, but the former more wooded. The engineer ascertained by
        consulting his pocket-compass that the direction of the river from the first turn was
        obviously southwest and northeast, and nearly straight for a length of about three miles.
        But it was to be supposed that this direction changed beyond that point, and that the Mercy
        continued to the north-west, towards the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which the river
        rose.</p><p>During one of these excursions, Gideon Spilett managed to get hold of two couples of living
        gallinaceae. They were birds with long, thin beaks, lengthened necks, short wings, and
        without any appearance of a tail. Herbert rightly gave them the name of tinamous, and it was
        resolved that they should be the first tenants of their future poultry-yard.</p><p>But till then the guns had not spoken, and the first report which awoke the echoes of the
        forest of the Far West was provoked by the appearance of a beautiful bird, resembling the
        kingfisher.</p><p>"I recognize him!" cried Pencroft, and it seemed as if his gun went off by itself.</p><p>"What do you recognize?" asked the reporter.</p><p>"The bird which escaped us on our first excursion, and from which we gave the name to that
        part of the forest."</p><p>"A jacamar!" cried Herbert.</p><p>It was indeed a jacamar, of which the plumage shines with a metallic luster. A shot brought
        it to the ground, and Top carried it to the canoe. At the same time half a dozen lories were
        brought down. The lory is of the size of a pigeon, the plumage dashed with green, part of
        the wings crimson, and its crest bordered with white. To the young boy belonged the honor of
        this shot, and he was proud enough of it. Lories are better food than the jacamar, the flesh
        of which is rather tough, but it was difficult to persuade Pencroft that he had not killed
        the king of eatable birds. It was ten o'clock in the morning when the canoe reached a second
        angle of the Mercy, nearly five miles from its mouth. Here a halt was made for breakfast
        under the shade of some splendid trees. The river still measured from sixty to seventy feet
        in breadth, and its bed from five to six feet in depth. The engineer had observed that it
        was increased by numerous affluents, but they were unnavigable, being simply little streams.
        As to the forest, including Jacamar Wood, as well as the forests of the Far West, it
        extended as far as the eye could reach. In no place, either in the depths of the forests or
        under the trees on the banks of the Mercy, was the presence of man revealed. The explorers
        could not discover one suspicious trace. It was evident that the woodman's axe had never
        touched these trees, that the pioneer's knife had never severed the creepers hanging from
        one trunk to another in the midst of tangled brushwood and long grass. If castaways had
        landed on the island, they could not have yet quitted the shore, and it was not in the woods
        that the survivors of the supposed shipwreck should be sought.</p><p>The engineer therefore manifested some impatience to reach the western coast of Lincoln
        Island, which was at least five miles distant according to his estimation.</p><p>The voyage was continued, and as the Mercy appeared to flow not towards the shore, but
        rather towards Mount Franklin, it was decided that they should use the boat as long as there
        was enough water under its keel to float it. It was both fatigue spared and time gained, for
        they would have been obliged to cut a path through the thick wood with their axes. But soon
        the flow completely failed them, either the tide was going down, and it was about the hour,
        or it could no longer be felt at this distance from the mouth of the Mercy. They had
        therefore to make use of the oars. Herbert and Neb each took one, and Pencroft took the
        scull. The forest soon became less dense, the trees grew further apart and often quite
        isolated. But the further they were from each other the more magnificent they appeared,
        profiting, as they did, by the free, pure air which circulated around them.</p><p>What splendid specimens of the flora of this latitude! Certainly their presence would have
        been enough for a botanist to name without hesitation the parallel which traversed Lincoln
        Island.</p><p>"Eucalypti!" cried Herbert.</p><p>They were, in fact, those splendid trees, the giants of the extratropical zone, the
        congeners of the Australian and New Zealand eucalyptus, both situated under the same
        latitude as Lincoln Island. Some rose to a height of two hundred feet. Their trunks at the
        base measured twenty feet in circumference, and their bark was covered by a network of
        farrows containing a red, sweet-smelling gum. Nothing is more wonderful or more singular
        than those enormous specimens of the order of the myrtaceae, with their leaves placed
        vertically and not horizontally, so that an edge and not a surface looks upwards, the effect
        being that the sun's rays penetrate more freely among the trees.</p><p>The ground at the foot of the eucalypti was carpeted with grass, and from the bushes
        escaped flights of little birds, which glittered in the sunlight like winged rubies.</p><p>"These are something like trees!" cried Neb; "but are they good for anything?"</p><p>"Pooh!" replied Pencroft. "Of course there are vegetable giants as well as human giants,
        and they are no good, except to show themselves at fairs!"</p><p>"I think that you are mistaken, Pencroft," replied Gideon Spilett, "and that the wood of
        the eucalyptus has begun to be very advantageously employed in cabinet-making."</p><p>"And I may add," said Herbert, "that the eucalyptus belongs to a family which comprises
        many useful members; the guava-tree, from whose fruit guava jelly is made; the clove-tree,
        which produces the spice; the pomegranate- tree, which bears pomegranates; the Eugeacia
        Cauliflora, the fruit of which is used in making a tolerable wine; the Ugui myrtle, which
        contains an excellent alcoholic liquor; the Caryophyllus myrtle, of which the bark forms an
        esteemed cinnamon; the Eugenia Pimenta, from whence comes Jamaica pepper; the common myrtle,
        from whose buds and berries spice is sometimes made; the Eucalyptus manifera, which yields a
        sweet sort of manna; the Guinea Eucalyptus, the sap of which is transformed into beer by
        fermentation; in short, all those trees known under the name of gum-trees or iron-bark trees
        in Australia, belong to this family of the myrtaceae, which contains forty-six genera and
        thirteen hundred species!"</p><p>The lad was allowed to run on, and he delivered his little botanical lecture with great
        animation. Cyrus Harding listened smiling, and Pencroft with an indescribable feeling of
        pride.</p><p>"Very good, Herbert," replied Pencroft, "but I could swear that all those useful specimens
        you have just told us about are none of them giants like these!"</p><p>"That is true, Pencroft."</p><p>"That supports what I said," returned the sailor, "namely, that these giants are good for
        nothing!"</p><p>"There you are wrong, Pencroft," said the engineer; "these gigantic eucalypti, which
        shelter us, are good for something."</p><p>"And what is that?"</p><p>"To render the countries which they inhabit healthy. Do you know what they are called in
        Australia and New Zealand?"</p><p>"No, captain."</p><p>"They are called 'fever trees.'"</p><p>"Because they give fevers?"</p><p>"No, because they prevent them!"</p><p>"Good. I must note that," said the reporter.</p><p>"Note it then, my dear Spilett; for it appears proved that the presence of the eucalyptus
        is enough to neutralize miasmas. This natural antidote has been tried in certain countries
        in the middle of Europe and the north of Africa where the soil was absolutely unhealthy, and
        the sanitary condition of the inhabitants has been gradually ameliorated. No more
        intermittent fevers prevail in the regions now covered with forests of the myrtaceae. This
        fact is now beyond doubt, and it is a happy circumstance for us settlers in Lincoln
        Island."</p><p>"Ah! what an island! What a blessed island!" cried Pencroft. "I tell you, it wants
        nothing--unless it is--"</p><p>"That will come, Pencroft, that will be found," replied the engineer; "but now we must
        continue our voyage and push on as far as the river will carry our boat!"</p><p>The exploration was therefore continued for another two miles in the midst of country
        covered with eucalypti, which predominated in the woods of this portion of the island. The
        space which they occupied extended as far as the eye could reach on each side of the Mercy,
        which wound along between high green banks. The bed was often obstructed by long weeds, and
        even by pointed rocks, which rendered the navigation very difficult. The action of the oars
        was prevented, and Pencroft was obliged to push with a pole. They found also that the water
        was becoming shallower and shallower, and that the canoe must soon stop. The sun was already
        sinking towards the horizon, and the trees threw long shadows on the ground. Cyrus Harding,
        seeing that he could not hope to reach the western coast of the island in one journey,
        resolved to camp at the place where any further navigation was prevented by want of water.
        He calculated that they were still five or six miles from the coast, and this distance was
        too great for them to attempt during the night in the midst of unknown woods.</p><p>The boat was pushed on through the forest, which gradually became thicker again, and
        appeared also to have more inhabitants; for if the eyes of the sailor did not deceive him,
        he thought he saw bands of monkeys springing among the trees. Sometimes even two or three of
        these animals stopped at a little distance from the canoe and gazed at the settlers without
        manifesting any terror, as if, seeing men for the first time, they had not yet learned to
        fear them. It would have been easy to bring down one of these quadramani with a gunshot, and
        Pencroft was greatly tempted to fire, but Harding opposed so useless a massacre. This was
        prudent, for the monkeys, or apes rather, appearing to be very powerful and extremely
        active, it was useless to provoke an unnecessary aggression, and the creatures might,
        ignorant of the power of the explorers' firearms, have attacked them. It is true that the
        sailor considered the monkeys from a purely alimentary point of view, for those animals
        which are herbivorous make very excellent game; but since they had an abundant supply of
        provisions, it was a pity to waste their ammunition.</p><p>Towards four o'clock, the navigation of the Mercy became exceedingly difficult, for its
        course was obstructed by aquatic plants and rocks. The banks rose higher and higher, and
        already they were approaching the spurs of Mount Franklin. The source could not be far off,
        since it was fed by the water from the southern slopes of the mountain.</p><p>"In a quarter of an hour," said the sailor, "we shall be obliged to stop, captain."</p><p>"Very well, we will stop, Pencroft, and we will make our encampment for the night."</p><p>"At what distance are we from Granite House?" asked Herbert.</p><p>"About seven miles," replied the engineer, "taking into calculation, however, the detours
        of the river, which has carried us to the northwest."</p><p>"Shall we go on?" asked the reporter.</p><p>"Yes, as long as we can," replied Cyrus Harding. "To-morrow, at break of day, we will leave
        the canoe, and in two hours I hope we shall cross the distance which separates us from the
        coast, and then we shall have the whole day in which to explore the shore."</p><p>"Go ahead!" replied Pencroft.</p><p>But soon the boat grated on the stony bottom of the river, which was now not more than
        twenty feet in breadth. The trees met like a bower overhead, and caused a half-darkness.
        They also heard the noise of a waterfall, which showed that a few hundred feet up the river
        there was a natural barrier.</p><p>Presently, after a sudden turn of the river, a cascade appeared through the trees. The
        canoe again touched the bottom, and in a few minutes it was moored to a trunk near the right
        bank.</p><p>It was nearly five o'clock. The last rays of the sun gleamed through the thick foliage and
        glanced on the little waterfall, making the spray sparkle with all the colors of the
        rainbow. Beyond that, the Mercy was lost in the bushwood, where it was fed from some hidden
        source. The different streams which flowed into it increased it to a regular river further
        down, but here it was simply a shallow, limpid brook.</p><p>It was agreed to camp here, as the place was charming. The colonists disembarked, and a
        fire was soon lighted under a clump of trees, among the branches of which Cyrus Harding and
        his companions could, if it was necessary, take refuge for the night.</p><p>Supper was quickly devoured, for they were very hungry, and then there was only sleeping to
        think of. But, as roarings of rather a suspicious nature had been heard during the evening,
        a good fire was made up for the night, so as to protect the sleepers with its crackling
        flames. Neb and Pencroft also watched by turns, and did not spare fuel. They thought they
        saw the dark forms of some wild animals prowling round the camp among the bushes, but the
        night passed without incident, and the next day, the 31st of October, at five o'clock in the
        morning, all were on foot, ready for a start.</p><p/></body></topic>
