   <title>BRIEG</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIEG,--> a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Silesia,
  on the left bank of the Oder, and on the Breslau and Beuthen railway, 27
  m. S.E. of the former city. Pop. (1900) 24,090. It has a castle (the
  residence of the old counts of Brieg), a lunatic asylum, a gymnasium with
  a good library, several churches and hospitals, and a theatre. Its
  fortifications were destroyed by the French in 1807, and are now replaced
  by beautiful promenades. Brieg carries on a considerable trade, its chief
  manufactures being linen, embroideries, cotton and woollen goods,
  ribbons, leather, machinery, hats, pasteboard and cigars. Important
  cattle-markets are held here. Brieg, or, as it is called in early
  documents, <i>Civitas Altae Ripae</i>, obtained municipal rights in 1250
  from Duke Henry III. of Breslau, and was fortified in 1297; its name is
  derived from the Polish <i>Brzeg</i> (shore). Burned by the Hussites in
  1428, the town was soon afterwards rebuilt, and in 1595 it was again
  fortified by Joachim Frederick, duke of Brieg. In the Thirty Years' War
  it suffered greatly; in that of the Austrian succession it was heavily
  bombarded by the Prussian forces; and in 1807 it was captured by the
  French and Bavarians. From 1311 to 1675 Brieg was the capital of an
  independent line of dukes, a cadet branch of the Polish dukes of Lower
  Silesia, by one of whom the castle was built in 1341. In 1537 Frederick
  II., duke of Liegnitz, Brieg and Wohlau, concluded with Joachim II.,
  elector of Brandenburg, a treaty according to which his duchy was to pass
  to the house of Brandenburg in the event of the extinction of his line.
  On the death of George William the last duke in 1675, however, Austria
  refused to acknowledge the validity of the treaty and annexed the
  duchies. It was the determination of Frederick II. of Prussia to assert
  his claim that led in 1740 to the war that ended two years later in the
  cession of Silesia to Prussia.</p>
