   <title>BRIEF</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIEF--> (Lat. <i>brevis</i>, short), in English legal practice,
  the written statement given to a barrister to form the basis of his case.
  It was probably so called from its at first being only a copy of the
  original writ. Upon a barrister devolves the duty of taking charge of a
  case when it comes into court, but all the preliminary work, such as the
  drawing up of the case, serving papers, marshalling evidence, &amp;c., is
  performed by a solicitor, so that a brief contains a concise summary for
  the information of counsel of the case which he has to plead, with all
  material facts in chronological order, and frequently such observations
  thereon as the solicitor may think fit to make, the names of witnesses,
  with the "proofs," that is, the nature of the evidence which each witness
  is ready to give, if called upon. The brief may also contain suggestions
  for the use of counsel when cross-examining witnesses called by the other
  side. Accompanying the brief may be copies of the pleadings (see <ph outputclass="sc">Pleading</ph>), and of all documents material to the case.
  The brief is always endorsed with the title of the court in which the
  action is to be tried, with the title of the action, and the names of the
  counsel and of the solicitor who delivers the brief. Counsel's fee is
  also marked. The delivery of a brief to counsel gives him authority to
  act for his client in all matters which the litigation involves. The
  result of the action is noted on the brief by counsel, or if the action
  is compromised, the terms of the compromise are endorsed on each brief
  and signed by the leading counsel on the opposite side. In Scotland a
  brief is called a memorial.</p>
      <p>In the United States the word has, to a certain extent, a different
  meaning, a brief in its English sense not being required, for the
  American attorney exercises all the functions distributed in England
  between barristers and solicitors. A lawyer sometimes prepares for his
  own use what is called a "trial brief" for use at the trial. This
  corresponds in all essential particulars with the "brief" prepared by the
  solicitor in England for the use of counsel. But the more distinctive use
  of the term in America is in the case of the brief "in error or appeal,"
  before an appellate court. This is a written or printed document, varying
  according to circumstances, but embodying the argument on the question
  affected. Most of the appellate courts require the filing of printed
  briefs for the use of the court and opposing counsel at a time designated
  for each side before hearing. In the rules of the United States Supreme
  Court and circuit courts of appeals the brief is required to contain a
  concise statement of the case, a specification of errors relied on,
  including the substance of evidence, the admission or rejection of which
  is to be reviewed, or any extract from a charge excepted to, and an
  argument exhibiting clearly the points of law or fact to be discussed.
  This form of brief, it may be added, is also adopted for use at the trial
  in certain states of the Union which require printed briefs to be
  delivered to the court.</p>
      <p>In English ecclesiastical law a brief meant letters patent issued out
  of chancery to churchwardens or other officers for the collection of
  money for church purposes. Such briefs were regulated by a statute of
  1704, but are now obsolete, though they are still to be found named in
  one of the rubrics in the Communion service of the Book of Common
  Prayer.</p>
      <p>The <i>brief-bag</i>, in which counsel's papers are carried to and
  from court, now forms an integral part of a barrister's outfit, but in
  the early part of the 19th century the possession of a brief-bag was
  strictly confined to those who had received one from a king's counsel.
  King's counsel were then few in number, were considered officers of the
  court, and had a salary of Â£40 a year, with a supply of paper, pens and
  purple bags. These bags they distributed among rising juniors of their
  acquaintance, <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page562">[v.04 p.0562]</ph>whose bundles of briefs were
  getting inconveniently large to be carried in their hands. These
  perquisites were abolished in 1830. English brief-bags are now either
  blue or red. Blue bags are those with which barristers provide themselves
  when first called, and it is a breach of etiquette to let this bag be
  visible in court. The only brief-bag allowed to be placed on the desks is
  the red bag, which by English legal etiquette is given by a leading
  counsel to a junior who has been useful to him in some important
  case.</p>
