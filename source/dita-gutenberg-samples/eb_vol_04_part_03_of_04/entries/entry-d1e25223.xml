   <title>BRUCKER, JOHANN JAKOB</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRUCKER, JOHANN JAKOB--> (1696-1770), German historian of
  philosophy, was born at Augsburg. He was destined for the church, and
  graduated at the university of Jena in 1718. He returned to Augsburg in
  1720, but became parish minister of Kaufbeuren in 1723. In 1731 he was
  elected a member of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and was invited to
  Augsburg as pastor and senior minister of the church of St Ulrich. His
  chief work, <i>Historia Critica Philosophiae</i>, appeared at Leipzig (5
  vols., 1742-1744). Its success was such that a new edition <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page678">[v.04 p.0678]</ph>was
  published in six volumes (1766-1767; English translation by W. Enfield,
  1791). It is by this work alone that Brucker is now known. Its merit
  consists entirely in the ample collection of materials. He also wrote
  <i>Tentamen Introductionis in Historiam Doctrinae de Ideis</i>,
  afterwards completed and republished under the title of <i>Historia
  Philosophicae Doctrinae de Ideis</i> (Augsburg, 1723); <i>Otium
  Vindelicum</i> (1731); <i>Kurze Fragen aus der philosophischen
  Historie</i> (7 vols., Ulm, 1731-1736), a history of philosophy in
  question and answer, containing many details, especially in the
  department of literary history, which he omitted in his chief work;
  <i>Pinacotheca Scriptorum nostra aetate literis illustrium, &amp;c.</i>
  (Augsburg, 1741-1755); <i>Ehrentempel der deutschen Gelehrsamkeit</i>
  (Augsburg, 1747-1749); <i>Institutiones Historiae Philosophicae</i>
  (Leipzig, 1747 and 1756; 3rd ed. with a continuation by F.G.B. Born
  (1743-1807) of Leipzig, in 1790); <i>Miscellanea Historiae Philosophicae
  Literariae Criticae olim sparsim edita</i> (Augsburg, 1748); <i>Erste
  Anfangsgrunde der philosophischen Geschichte</i> (Ulm, 1751). He
  superintended an edition of Luther's translation of the Old and New
  Testament, with a commentary extracted from the writings of the English
  theologians (Leipzig, 1758-1770, completed by W.A. Teller). He died at
  Augsburg in 1770.</p>
