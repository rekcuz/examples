   <title>BRIOSCO, ANDREA</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIOSCO, ANDREA--> (<i>c.</i> 1470-1532), Italian sculptor and
  architect, known as Riccio ("curly-headed"), was born at Padua. In
  architecture he is known by the church of Sta Giustina in his native
  city, but he is most famous as a worker in metal. His masterpieces are
  the bronze Paschal candelabrum (11 ft. high) in the choir of the Santo
  (S. Antonio) at Padua (1515), and the two bronze reliefs (1507) of "David
  dancing before the Ark" and "Judith and Holofernes" in the same church.
  His bronze and marble tomb of the physician Girolamo della Torre in San
  Fermo at Verona was beautifully decorated with reliefs, which were taken
  away by the French and are now in the Louvre. A number of other works
  which emanated from his workshop are attributed to him; and he has been
  suggested, but doubtfully, as the author of a fine bronze relief, a
  "Dance of Nymphs," in the Wallace collection at Hertford House,
  London.</p>
