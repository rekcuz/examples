   <title>BROWNE, SIR JAMES</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROWNE, SIR JAMES--> (1839-1896), Anglo-Indian engineer and
  administrator, was the son of Robert Browne of Falkirk in Scotland. He
  was educated at the military college, Addiscombe, and received a
  commission in the Bengal engineers in 1857. He served in the expedition
  against the Mahsud Waziris in 1860, being mentioned in despatches, and in
  1863 in the Umbeyla campaign, when he was three times mentioned. In
  January 1875 he became superintendent of works for the building of the
  Indus bridge. In 1877 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel, and in
  1878-1879 accompanied Sir Donald Stewart as political officer during the
  Afghan War. He took part in several engagements, was mentioned in
  despatches, and received the C.B. In 1881 he became colonel, and in 1882
  commanded the Indian engineer contingent sent to Egypt, being present at
  the battle of Tell-el-Kebir. For his services in Egypt he received the
  3rd class of the Osmanieh Order and the khedive's star. In 1884 he was
  appointed engineer in chief of the Sind-Pishin railway. In 1888 he was
  made a K.C.S.I, and in 1889 quarter-master-general for India. In 1892 he
  was appointed agent to the governor-general in Baluchistan, in succession
  to Sir Robert Sandeman, his intimate experience of the Baluchis, gained
  during his railway work, having specially fitted him for this post. He
  died suddenly on the 13th of June 1896. Sir James Browne was a man of
  splendid courage and physique, and many tales are told of the personal
  prowess which, together with his sympathetic knowledge of the natives,
  made him a popular hero among the frontier tribesmen.</p>
