      <p><!--BRODERIP, WILLIAM JOHN--> (1789-1859), English naturalist, was
  born in Bristol on the 21st of November 1789. After graduating at Oxford
  he was called to the bar in 1817, and for some years was engaged in
  law-reporting. In 1822 he was appointed a metropolitan police magistrate,
  and filled that office until 1856, first at the Thames police court and
  then at Westminster. His leisure was devoted to natural history, and his
  writings did much to further the study of zoology in England. The
  zoological articles in the <i>Penny Cyclopaedia</i> were written by him,
  and a series of articles contributed to <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> were
  reprinted in 1848 as <i>Zoological Recreations</i>, and were followed in
  1852 by <i>Leaves from the Note-book of a Naturalist</i>. He was one of
  the founders of the Zoological Society of London, and a large collection
  of shells which he formed was ultimately bought by the British Museum. He
  died in London on the 27th of February 1859.</p>
