   <title>BRONGNIART, ADOLPHE THÉODORE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRONGNIART, ADOLPHE THÉODORE--> (1801-1876), French botanist, son
  of the geologist Alexandre Brongniart, was born in Paris on the 14th of
  January 1801. He soon showed an inclination towards the study of natural
  science, devoting himself at first more particularly to geology, and
  later to botany, thus equipping himself for what was to be the main
  occupation of his life—the investigation of fossil plants. In 1826
  he graduated as doctor of medicine with a dissertation on the Rhamnaceae;
  but the career which he adopted was botanical, not medical. In 1831 he
  became assistant to R.L. Desfontaines at the Musée d'Histoire Naturelle,
  and two years later succeeded him as professor, a position which he
  continued to hold until his death in Paris on the 18th of February
  1876.</p>
      <p>Brongniart was an indefatigable investigator and a prolific writer, so
  that he left behind him, as the fruit of his labours, a large number of
  books and memoirs. As early as 1822 he published a paper on the
  classification and distribution of fossil plants (<i>Mém. Mus. Hist.
  Nat.</i> viii.). This was followed by several papers chiefly bearing upon
  the relation between extinct and existing forms—a line of research
  which culminated in the publication of the <i>Histoire des végétaux
  fossiles</i>, which has earned for him the title of "father of
  palaeobotany." This great work was heralded by a small but most important
  "Prodrome" (contributed to the <i>Grand Dictionnaire d'Hist. Nat.</i>,
  1828, t. lvii.) which brought order into chaos by a classification in
  which the fossil plants were arranged, with remarkably correct insight,
  along with their nearest living allies, and which forms the basis of all
  subsequent progress in this direction. It is of especial botanical
  interest, because, in accordance with Robert Brown's discoveries, the
  Cycadeae and Coniferae were placed in the new group <i>Phanérogames
  gymnospermes</i>. In this book attention was also directed to the
  succession of forms in the various geological periods, with the important
  result (stated in modern terms) that in the Palaeozoic period the
  Pteridophyta are found to predominate; in the Mesozoic, the Gymnosperms;
  in the Cainozoic, the Angiosperms, a result subsequently more fully
  stated in his "Tableau des genres de végétaux fossiles" (D'Orbigny,
  <i>Dict. Univ. d'Hist. Nat.</i>, 1849). But the great <i>Histoire</i>
  itself was not destined to be more than a colossal fragment; the
  publication of successive parts proceeded regularly from 1828 to 1837,
  when the first volume was completed, but after that only three parts of
  the second volume appeared. Brongniart, no doubt, was overwhelmed with
  the continually increasing magnitude of the task that he had undertaken.
  Apart from his more comprehensive works, his most important
  palaeontological contributions are perhaps his observations on the
  structure of <i>Sigillaria</i> (<i>Arch. Mus. Hist. Nat.</i> i., 1839)
  and his researches (almost the last he undertook) on fossil seeds, of
  which a full account was published posthumously in 1880. His activity was
  by no means confined to palaeobotany, but extended into all branches of
  botany, more particularly anatomy and phanerogamic taxonomy. Among his
  achievements in these directions the most notable is the memoir "Sur la
  génération et le développement de l'embryon des Phanérogames" (<i>Ann.
  Sci. Nat.</i> xii., 1827). This is remarkable in that it contains the
  <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page637">[v.04
  p.0637]</ph>first account of any value of the development of the
  pollen; as also a description of the structure of the pollen-grain, the
  confirmation of G. B. Amici's (1823) discovery of the pollen-tube, the
  confirmation of R. Brown's views as to the structure of the unimpregnated
  ovule (with the introduction of the term "sac embryonnaire"); and in that
  it shows how nearly Brongniart anticipated Amici's subsequent (1846)
  discovery of the entrance of the pollen-tube into the micropyle,
  fertilizing the female cell which then develops into the embryo. Of his
  anatomical works, those of the greatest value are probably the
  "<i>Recherches sur la structure et les fonctions des feuilles</i>"
  (<i>Ann. Sci. Nat.</i> xxi., 1830), and the "Nouvelles Recherches sur
  l'Épiderme" (<i>Ann. Sci. Nat.</i> i., 1834), in which, among other
  important observations, the discovery of the cuticle is recorded; and,
  further, the "Recherches sur l'organisation des tiges des Cycadées"
  (<i>Ann. Sci. Nat.</i> xvi., 1829), giving the results of the first
  investigation of the anatomy of those plants. His systematic work is
  represented by a large number of papers and monographs, many of which
  relate to the flora of New Caledonia; and by his <i>Énumération des
  genres de plantes cultivées au Musée d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris</i>
  (1843), which is an interesting landmark in the history of classification
  in that it forms the starting-point of the system, modified successively
  by A. Braun, A.W. Eichler and A. Engler, which is now adopted in Germany.
  In addition to his scientific and professorial labours, Brongniart held
  various important official posts in connexion with the department of
  education, and interested himself greatly in agricultural and
  horticultural matters. With J.V. Audouin and J.B.A. Dumas, his future
  brothers-in-law, he established the <i>Annales des Sciences
  Naturelles</i> in 1824; he also founded the Société Botanique de France
  in 1854, and was its first president.</p>

  France</i>, 1876, and <i>La Nature</i>, 1876; the <i>Bulletin de la Soc.
  Bot. de France</i> for 1876, vol. xxiii., contains a list of his works
  and the orations pronounced at his funeral.</p>
