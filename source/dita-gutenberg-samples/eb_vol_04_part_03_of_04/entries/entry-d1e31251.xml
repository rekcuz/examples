   <title>BUDAUN</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUDAUN,--> a town and district of British India, in the Rohilkhand
  division of the United Provinces. The town is near the left bank of the
  river Sot. Pop. (1901) 39,031. There are ruins of an immense fort and a
  very handsome mosque of imposing size, crowned with a dome, and built in
  1223 in great part from the materials of an ancient Hindu temple. The
  American Methodist mission maintains several girls' schools, and there is
  a high school for boys. According to tradition Budaun was founded about
  <ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph> 905, and an inscription, probably of the
  12th century, gives a list of twelve Rathor kings reigning at Budaun
  (called Vodamayuta). The first authentic historical event connected with
  it, however, is its capture by Kutb-ud-din in 1196, after which it became
  a very important post on the northern frontier of the Delhi empire. In
  the 13th century two of its governors, Shams-ud-din Altamsh, the builder
  of the great mosque referred to above, and his son Rukn-ud-din Firoz,
  attained the imperial throne. In 1571 the town was burnt, and about a
  hundred years later, under Shah Jahan, the seat of the governorship was
  transferred to Bareilly; after which the importance of Budaun declined.
  It ultimately came into the power of the Rohillas, and in 1838 was made
  the headquarters of a British district. In 1857 the people of Budaun
  sided with the mutineers, and a native government was set up, which
  lasted until General Penny's victory at Kakrala (April 1858) led to the
  restoration of British authority.</p>
      <p>The <ph outputclass="sc">District Of Budaun</ph> has an area of 1987 sq.
  m. Pop. (1901) 1,025,753. The country is low, level, and is generally
  fertile, and watered by the Ganges, the Ramganga, the Sot or Yarwafadar,
  and the Mahawa. Budaun district was ceded to the British government in
  1801 by the nawab of Oudh. There are several indigo factories. The
  district is crossed by two lines of the Oudh &amp; Rohilkhand railway,
  and by a narrow-gauge line from Bareilly. The chief centre of trade is
  Bilsi.</p>
