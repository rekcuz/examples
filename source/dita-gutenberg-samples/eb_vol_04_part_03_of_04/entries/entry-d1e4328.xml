   <title>BRIDGE OF ALLAN</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIDGE OF ALLAN-->, a police burgh of Stirlingshire, Scotland.
  Pop. (1901) 3240. It lies on the Allan, a left-hand tributary of the
  Forth, 3 m. N. of Stirling by the Caledonian railway and by tramway.
  Built largely on the well-wooded slopes of Westerton and Airthrey Hill,
  sheltered by the Ochils from the north and east winds, and environed by
  charming scenery, it has a great reputation as a health resort and
  watering-place, especially in winter and spring. There is a pump-room.
  The chief buildings are the hydropathic and the Macfarlane museum of fine
  art and natural history. The industries include bleaching, dyeing and
  paper-making. The Strathallan Gathering, usually held in the
  neighbourhood, is the most popular athletic meeting in mid-Scotland.
  Airthrey Castle, standing in a fine park with a lake, adjoins the town on
  the south-east, and just beyond it are the old church and burying-ground
  of Logie, beautifully situated at the foot of a granite spur of the Ochil
  range.</p>
