   <title>BRETON, JULES ADOLPHE AIMÉ LOUIS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRETON, JULES ADOLPHE AIMÉ LOUIS--> (1827- ), French painter, was
  born on the 1st of May 1827, at Courrières, Pas de Calais, France. His
  artistic gifts being manifest at an early age, he was sent in 1843 to
  Ghent, to study under the historical painter de Vigne, and in 1846 to
  Baron Wappers at Antwerp. Finally he worked in Paris under Drolling. His
  first efforts were in historical subjects: "Saint Piat preaching in
  Gaul"; then, under the influence of the revolution of 1848, he
  represented "Misery and Despair." But Breton soon discovered that he was
  not born to be a historical painter, and he returned to the memories of
  nature and of the country which were impressed on him in early youth. In
  1853 he exhibited the "Return of the Harvesters" at the Paris Salon, and
  the "Little Gleaner" at Brussels. Thenceforward he was essentially a
  painter of rustic life, especially in the province of Artois, which he
  quitted only three times for short excursions: in 1864 to Provence, and
  in 1865 and 1873 to Brittany, whence he derived some of his happiest
  studies of religious scenes. His numerous subjects may be divided
  generally into four classes: labour, rest, rural festivals and religious
  festivals. Among his more important works may be named "Women Gleaning,"
  and "The Day after St Sebastian's Day" (1855), which gained him a
  third-class medal; "Blessing the Fields" (1857), a second-class medal;
  "Erecting a Calvary" (1859), now in the Lille gallery; "The Return of the
  Gleaners" (1859), now in the Luxembourg; "Evening" and "Women Weeding"
  (1861), a first-class medal; "Grandfather's Birthday" (1862); "The Close
  of Day" (1865); "Harvest" (1867); "Potato Gatherers" (1868); "A Pardon,
  Brittany" (1869); "The Fountain" (1872), medal of honour; "The Bonfires
  of St John" (1875); "Women mending Nets" (1876), in the Douai museum; "A
  Gleaner" (1877), Luxembourg; "Evening, Finistère" (1881); "The Song of
  the Lark" (1884); "The Last Sunbeam" (1885); "The Shepherd's Star"
  (1888); "The Call Home" (1889); "The Last Gleanings" (1895); "Gathering
  Poppies" (1897); "The Alarm Cry" (1899); "Twilight Glory" (1900). Breton
  was elected to the Institut in 1886 on the death of Baudry. In 1889 he
  was made commander of the Legion of Honour, and in 1899 foreign member of
  the Royal Academy of London. He also wrote several books, among them
  <i>Les Champs et la mer</i> (1876), <i>Nos peintres du siècle</i> (1900),
  "Jeanne," a poem, <i>Delphine Bernard</i> (1902), and <i>La Peinture</i>
  (1904).</p>
