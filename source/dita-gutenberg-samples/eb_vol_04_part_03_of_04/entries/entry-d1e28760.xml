   <title>BUCCINA</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCCINA--> (more correctly <i>Būcĭna</i>, Gr. <ph outputclass="grk">Βυκάνη</ph>, connected with
  <i>bucca</i>, cheek, and Gr. <ph outputclass="grk">Βύζω</ph>, a brass wind instrument extensively
  used in the ancient Roman army. The Roman instrument consisted of a brass
  tube measuring some 11 to 12 ft. in length, of narrow cylindrical bore,
  and played by means of a cup-shaped mouthpiece. The tube is bent round
  upon itself from the mouthpiece to the bell in the shape of a broad C and
  is strengthened by means of a bar across the curve, which the performer
  grasps while playing, in order to steady the instrument; the bell curves
  over his head or shoulder as in the modern helicon. Three Roman buccinas
  were found among the ruins of Pompeii and are now deposited in the museum
  at Naples. V. C. Mahillon, of Brussels<xref href="#d1e28760/Footnote_221" type="fn"><!--[1]--></xref> has made a facsimile of one of
  these instruments; it is in G and has almost the same harmonic series as
  the French horn and the trumpet. The buccina, the cornu (see <ph outputclass="sc">Horn</ph>), and the tuba were used as signal instruments in
  the Roman army and camp to sound the four night watches (hence known as
  <i>buccina prima, secunda, &amp;c.</i>), to summon them by means of the
  special signal known as <i>classicum</i>, and to give orders.<xref href="#d1e28760/Footnote_222" type="fn"><!--[2]--></xref> Frontinus
  relates<xref href="#d1e28760/Footnote_223" type="fn"><!--[3]--></xref>
  that a Roman general, who had been surrounded by the enemy, escaped
  during the night by means of the stratagem of leaving behind him a
  <i>buccinator</i> (trumpeter), who sounded <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page712">[v.04 p.0712]</ph>the watches
  throughout the night.<xref href="#d1e28760/Footnote_224" type="fn"><!--[4]--></xref> Vegetius gives brief descriptions
  of the three instruments, which suffice to establish their identity; the
  tuba, he says, is straight; the buccina is of bronze bent in the form of
  a circle.<xref href="#d1e28760/Footnote_225" type="fn"><!--[5]--></xref>

      <p>The buccina, in respect of its technical construction and acoustic
  properties, was the ancestor of both trumpet and trombone; the connexion
  is further established by the derivation of the words Sackbut and
  <i>Posaune</i> (the German for trombone) from buccina. The relation was
  fully recognized in Germany during the 15th and 16th centuries, as two
  translations of Vegetius, published at Ulm in 1470, and at Augsburg in
  1534, clearly demonstrate: "Bucina das ist die trumet oder pusan"<xref href="#d1e28760/Footnote_226" type="fn"><!--[6]--></xref> ("the bucina
  is the trumpet or trombone") and ("Bucina ist die trummet die wirt ausz
  und eingezogen"<xref href="#d1e28760/Footnote_227" type="fn"><!--[7]--></xref> ("the bucina is the trumpet which
  is drawn out and in"). A French translation by Jean de Meung (Paris,
  1488),<xref href="#d1e28760/Footnote_228" type="fn"><!--[8]--></xref>
  renders the passage (chap. iii. 5) thus: "Trompe est longue et droite;
  buisine est courte et reflechist en li meisme si comme partie de cercle."
  On Trajan's column<xref href="#d1e28760/Footnote_229" type="fn"><!--[9]--></xref> the tuba, the cornu and the
  buccina are distinguishable. Other illustrations of the buccina may be
  seen in François Mazois' <i>Les Ruines de Pompéi</i> (Paris, 1824-1838),
  pt. iv, pl. xlviii. fig. 1, and in J.N. von Wilmowsky's <i>Eine römische
  Villa zu Nennig</i> (Bonn, 1865), pl. xii. (mosaics), where the
  buccinator is accompanied on the hydraulus. The military buccina
  described is a much more advanced instrument than its prototype the
  <i>buccina marina</i>, a primitive trumpet in the shape of a conical
  shell, often having a spiral twist, which in poetry is often called
  <i>concha</i>. The buccina marina is frequently depicted in the hands of
  Tritons (Macrobius i. 8), or of sailors, as for instance on terra-cotta
  lamp shown by G.P. Bellori (<i>Lucernae veterum sepulcrales iconicae</i>,
  1702, iii. 12). The highly imaginative writer of the apocryphal letter of
  St Jerome to Dardanus also has a word to say concerning the buccina among
  the Semitic races: "Bucca vocatur tuba apud Hebreos: deinde per
  diminutionem buccina dicitur." After the fall of the Roman empire the art
  of bending metal tubes was gradually lost, and although the buccina
  survived in Europe both in name and in principle of construction during
  the middle ages, it lost for ever the characteristic curve like a "C"
  which it possessed in common with the cornu, an instrument having a
  conical bore of wider calibre. Although we regard the buccina as
  essentially Roman, an instrument of the same type, but probably straight
  and of kindred name, was widely known and used in the East, in Persia,
  Arabia and among the Semitic races. After a lapse of years during which
  records are almost wanting, the buccina reappeared all over Europe as the
  busine, buisine, pusin, busaun, pusun, posaun, busna (Slav), &amp;c.;
  whether it was a Roman survival or a re-introduction through the Moors of
  Spain in the West and the Byzantine empire in the East, we have no
  records to show. An 11th-century mural painting representing the Last
  Judgment in the cathedral of S. Angelo in Formis (near Capua), shows the
  angels blowing the last trump on busines.<xref href="#d1e28760/Footnote_2210" type="fn"><!--[10]--></xref>
      </p>
      <p>There are two distinct forms of the busine which may be traced during
  the middle ages:—(i) a long straight tube (fig. 2) consisting of 3
  to 5 joints of narrow cylindrical bore, the last joint alone being
  conical and ending in a pommel-shaped bell, precisely as in the curved
  buccina (fig. 1); (2) a long straight cylindrical tube of somewhat wider
  bore than the busine, ending in a wide bell curving out abruptly from the
  cylindrical tube (fig. 3).</p>
      <p>The history of the development of the trumpet, the sackbut and the
  trombone from the buccina will be found more fully treated under those
  headings; for the part played by the buccina in the evolution of the
  French horn see <ph outputclass="sc">Horn</ph>.</p>
