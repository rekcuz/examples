      <p><!--BROOKE, STOPFORD AUGUSTUS--> (1832- ), English divine and man of
  letters, born at Letterkenny, Donegal, Ireland, in 1832, was educated at
  Trinity College, Dublin. He was ordained in the Church of England in
  1857, and held various charges in London. From 1863 to 1865 he was
  chaplain to the empress Frederick in Berlin, and in 1872 he became
  chaplain in ordinary to Queen Victoria. But in 1880 he seceded from the
  Church, being no longer able to accept its leading dogmas, and officiated
  as a Unitarian minister for some years at Bedford chapel, Bloomsbury.
  Bedford chapel was pulled down about 1894, and from that time he had no
  church of his own, but his eloquence and powerful religious personality
  continued to make themselves felt among a wide circle. A man of
  independent means, he was always keenly interested in literature and art,
  and a fine critic of both. He published in 1865 his <i>Life and Letters
  of F. W. Robertson</i> (of Brighton), and in 1876 wrote an admirable
  primer of <i>English Literature</i> (new and revised ed., 1900), followed
  in 1892 by <i>The History of Early English Literature</i> (2 vols., 1892)
  down to the accession of Alfred, and <i>English Literature from the
  Beginnings to the Norman Conquest</i> (1898). His other works include
  various volumes of sermons; <i>Poems</i> (1888); <i>Dove Cottage</i>
  (1890); <i>Theology in the English Poetsâ€”Cowper, Coleridge,
  Wordsworth, Burns</i> (1874); <i>Tennyson, his Art and Relation to Modern
  Life</i> (1894); <i>The Poetry of Robert Browning</i> (1902); <i>On Ten
  Plays of Shakespeare</i> (1905); and <i>The Life Superlative</i>
  (1906).</p>
