   <body>
      <p><!--BRUCHSAL,--> a town of Germany, in the grand-duchy of Baden,
  prettily situated on the Saalbach, 14 m. N. from Karlsruhe, and an
  important junction on the main railway from Mannheim to Constance. Pop.
  (1900), including a small garrison, 13,555. There are an Evangelical and
  four Roman Catholic churches, among the latter that of St Peter, the
  burial-place of the bishops of Spires, whose princely residence (now used
  as a prison) lies in the vicinity. Bruchsal has a fine palace, with
  beautiful grounds attached, a town hall, a classical, a modern and a
  commercial school, and manufactures of machinery, paper, tobacco, soap
  and beer, and does a considerable trade in wine. Bruchsal (mentioned in
  937 as <i>Bruxolegum</i>) was originally a royal villa (<i>Königshof</i>)
  belonging to the emperors and German kings. Given in 1002 to Otto, duke
  of Franconia, it was inherited by the cadet line of Spires, the head of
  which, the emperor Henry III., gave it to the see of Spires in 1095. From
  1105 onward it became the summer residence of the bishops, who in 1190
  bought the <i>Vogtei</i> (advocateship) from the counts of Calw, and the
  place rapidly developed into a town. It remained in the possession of the
  bishops till 1802, when by the treaty of Lunéville it was ceded, with
  other lands of the bishopric on the right bank of the Rhine, to Baden.
  The Peasants' War during the Reformation period first broke out in
  Bruchsal. In 1609 it was captured by the elector palatine, and in 1676
  and 1698 it was burnt down by the French. In 1849 it was the scene of an
  engagement between the Prussians and the Baden revolutionists.</p>
