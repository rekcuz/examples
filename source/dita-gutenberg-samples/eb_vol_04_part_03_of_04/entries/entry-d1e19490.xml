   <title>BRITTON</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRITTON,--> the title of the earliest summary of the law of
  England in the French tongue, which purports to have been written by
  command of King Edward I. The origin and authorship of the work have been
  much disputed. It has been attributed to John le Breton, bishop of
  Hereford, on the authority of a passage found in some MSS. of the history
  of Matthew of Westminster; there are difficulties, however, involved in
  this theory, inasmuch as the bishop of Hereford died in 1275, whereas
  allusions are made in <i>Britton</i> to several statutes passed after
  that time, and more particularly to the well-known statute <i>Quia
  emptores terrarum</i>, which was passed in 1290. It was the opinion of
  Selden that the book derived its title from Henry de Bracton, the last of
  the chief justiciaries, whose name is sometimes spelled in the fine Rolls
  "Bratton" and "Bretton", and that it was a royal abridgment of Bracton's
  great work on the customs and laws of England, with the addition of
  certain subsequent statutes. The arrangement, however, of the two works
  is different, and but a small proportion of Bracton's work is
  incorporated in <i>Britton</i>. The work is entitled in an early MS. of
  the 14th century, which was once in the possession of Selden, and is now
  in the Cambridge university library, <i>Summa de legibus Anglie que
  vocatur Bretone</i>; and it is described as "a book called Bretoun" in
  the will of Andrew Horn, the learned chamberlain of the city of London,
  who bequeathed it to the chamber of the Guildhall in 1329, together with
  another book called <i>Mirroir des Justices</i>.</p>

         <i>Britton</i> was first printed in London by Robert Redman, without a
  date, probably about the year 1530. Another edition of it was printed in
  1640, corrected by E. Wingate. A third edition of it, with an English
  translation, was published at the University Press, Oxford, 1865, by F.
  M. Nichol. An English translation of the work without the Latin text had
  been previously published by R. Kelham in 1762.</p>
