   <title>BUCKINGHAMSHIRE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCKINGHAMSHIRE--> (abbreviated <i>Bucks</i>) a south midland
  county of England, bounded N. by Northamptonshire, E. by Bedfordshire,
  Hertfordshire and Middlesex, S. for a short distance by Surrey, and by
  Berkshire, and W. by Oxfordshire. Its area is 743.2 sq. m. The county is
  divided between the basins of the rivers Ouse and Thames. The first in
  its uppermost course forms part of the north-western boundary, passes the
  towns of Buckingham, Stony Stratford, Wolverton, Newport Pagnell and
  Olney, and before quitting the county forms a short stretch of the
  north-eastern boundary. The principal tributary it receives within the
  county is the Ouzel. The Thames forms the entire southern boundary; and
  of its tributaries Buckinghamshire includes the upper part of the Thames.
  To the north-west of Buckingham, and both east and west of the Ouzel, the
  land rises in gentle undulations to a height of nearly 500 ft., and north
  of the Thames valley a few nearly isolated hills stand boldly, such as
  Brill Hill and Muswell Hill, each over 600 ft., but the hilliest <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page729">[v.04
  p.0729]</ph>part of the county is the south, which is occupied by part
  of the Chiltern system, the general direction of which is from south-west
  to north-east. The crest-line of these hills crosses the county at its
  narrowest point, along a line, above the towns of Prince's Risborough and
  Wendover, not exceeding 11 m. in length. This line divides the county
  into two parts of quite different physical character; for to the south
  almost the whole land is hilly (the longer slope of the Chiltern system
  lying in this direction), well wooded, and pleasantly diversified with
  narrow vales. The chief of these are watered by the Wye, Misbourne and
  Chess streams. The beech tree is predominant in the woods, in so much
  that William Camden, writing c. 1585, supposed the county to take name
  from this feature (A.S. <i>boc</i>, beech). In the south a remnant of
  ancient forest is preserved as public ground under the name of Burnham
  Beeches. The Chilterns reach a height of nearly 900 ft. within the
  county.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Geology.</i>—The northern half of the county is occupied by
  Jurassic strata, in the southern half Cretaceous rocks predominate except
  in the south-eastern corner, where they are covered by Tertiary beds.
  Thus the oldest rocks are in the north, succeeded continuously by younger
  strata to the south; the general dip of all the rocks is south-easterly.
  A few patches of Upper Lias Clay appear near the northern boundary near
  Grafton Regis and Castle Thorpe, and again in the valley of the Ouse near
  Stoke Goldington and Weston Underwood. The Oolitic series is represented
  by the Great Oolite, with limestones in the upper part, much quarried for
  building stones at Westbury, Thornborough, Brock, Whittlewood Forest,
  &amp;c.; the lower portions are more argillaceous. The Forest Marble is
  seen about Thornton as a thin bed of clay with an oyster-bearing
  limestone at the base. Next above is the Cornbrash, a series of rubbly
  and occasionally hard limestones and thin clays. The outcrop runs by
  Tingwick, Buckingham, Berehampton and Newport Pagnell, it is quarried at
  Wolverton and elsewhere for road metal. Inliers of these rocks occur at
  Marsh Gibbon and Stan Hill. The Oxford Clay and Kimmeridge Clay, with the
  Gault, lie in the vale of Aylesbury. The clay is covered by numerous
  outliers of Portland, Purbeck and Lower Greensand beds. The Portland beds
  are sandy below, calcareous above; the outcrop follows the normal
  direction in the county, from south-west to north-east, from Thame
  through Aylesbury; they are quarried at several places for building stone
  and fossils are abundant. The Hartwell Clay is in the Lower Portland.
  Freshwater Purbeck beds lie below the Portland and Lower Greensand beds;
  they cap the ridge between Oving and Whitchurch. Glass-making sands have
  been worked from the Lower Greensand at Hartwell, and phosphatic nodules
  from the same beds at Brickhill as well as from the Gault at Towersey. A
  broad band of Gault, a bluish clay, extends from Towersey across the
  county in a north-easterly direction. Resting upon the Gault is the Upper
  Greensand; at the junction of the two formations numerous springs arise,
  a circumstance which has no doubt determined the site of several
  villages. The Chalk rises abruptly from the low lying argillaceous plain
  to form the Chiltern Hills. The form of the whole of the hilly district
  round Chesham, High Wycombe and the Chalfonts is determined by the Chalk.
  Reading beds, mottled clays and sands, repose upon the Chalk at Woburn,
  Barnham, Fulmer and Denham, and these are in turn covered by the London
  Clay, which is exposed on the slopes about Stoke Common and Iver. Between
  the Tertiary-capped Chalk plateau and the Thames, a gentler slope,
  covered with alluvial gravel and brick earth, reaches down to the river.
  Thick deposits of plateau gravel cover most of the high ground in the
  southern corner of the county, while much of the northern part is
  obscured by glacial clays and gravels.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Industries.</i>—The agricultural capacities of the soil vary
  greatly in different localities. On the lower lands, especially in the
  Vale of Aylesbury, about the headwaters of the Thame, it is extremely
  fertile; while on the hills it is usually poor and thin. The proportion
  of cultivated land is high, being about 83% of the whole. Of this a large
  and growing portion is in permanent pasture; cattle and sheep being
  reared in great numbers for the London markets, to which also are sent
  quantities of ducks, for which the district round Aylesbury is famous.
  Wheat and oats are the principal grain crops, though both decrease in
  importance. Turnips and swedes for the cattle are the chief green crops;
  and dairy-farming is largely practised. There is no general manufacturing
  industry, but a considerable amount of lace-making and straw-plaiting is
  carried on locally; and at High Wycombe and in its neighbourhood there is
  a thriving trade in various articles of turnery, such as chairs and
  bowls, from beech and other hard woods. The introduction of lace-making
  in this and neighbouring counties is attributed to Flemish, and later to
  French immigrants, but also to Catharine of Aragon during her residence
  (c. 1532) at Ampthill. Down to the later part of the 19th century a
  general holiday celebrated by lace-makers on the 25th of November was
  known as "Cattarn's Day."</p>
      <p>
         <i>Communications.</i>—The main line of the London &amp;
  North-Western railway crosses the north-east part of the county.
  Bletchley is an important junction on this system, branches diverging
  east to Fenny Stratford, Bedford and Cambridge, and west to Oxford and
  Banbury, Buckingham being served by the western branch. There is also a
  branch from Cheddington to Aylesbury. The Metropolitan-Great Central
  joint line serves Amersham, Chesham (by a branch), and Aylesbury, joining
  the North-Western Oxford branch at Verney Junction; this line is used by
  the Great Central railway, the main line of which continues
  north-westward from Quainton Road. A light railway connects this station
  with the large village of Brill to the south-west. The Great Central and
  the Great Western companies jointly own a line passing through
  Beaconsfield, High Wycombe, and Prince's Risborough, which is connected
  northward with the Great Central system. Before the opening of this line
  in 1906 the Great Western branch from Maidenhead to Oxford was the only
  line serving High Wycombe and Prince's Risborough, from which there are
  branches to Watlington and Aylesbury. The main line of this company
  crosses the extreme south of the county by Slough and Taplow. The Grand
  Junction Canal, reaching the valley of the Ouse by way of the Ouzel
  valley from the south, has branches to Aylesbury and to Buckingham.
  Except the Thames none of the rivers in the county is continuously
  navigable.</p>

         <i>Population and Administration.</i>—The area of the ancient
  county is 475,682 acres, with a population in 1891 of 185,284, and in
  1901 of 195,764. The area of the administrative county is 479,358 acres.
  The county contains eight hundreds, of which three, namely Stoke, Burnham
  and Desborough, form the "Chiltern Hundreds" (<i>q.v.</i>). The hundred
  of Aylesbury retains its ancient designation of the "three hundreds of
  Aylesbury." The municipal boroughs are Buckingham, the county town (pop.
  3152), and Wycombe, officially Chepping Wycombe, also Chipping or High
  Wycombe (15,542). The other urban districts are Aylesbury (9243),
  Beaconsfield (1570), Chesham (7245), Eton (3301), Fenny Stratford (4799),
  Linslade, on the Ouzel opposite to Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire
  (2157), Marlow (4526), Newport Pagnell (4028), Slough (11,453). Among the
  lesser market towns may be mentioned Amersham (2674), Ivinghoe (808),
  Olney (2684), Prince's Risborough (2189), Stony Stratford (2353),
  Wendover (2009) and Winslow (1703). At Wolverton (5323) are the carriage
  works of the London &amp; North-Western railway. Several of the villages
  on and near the banks of the Thames have become centres of residence,
  such as Taplow, Cookham and Bourne End, Burnham and Wooburn.
  Buckinghamshire is in the midland circuit, and assizes are held at
  Aylesbury. It has one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into
  thirteen petty sessional divisions. The boroughs of Buckingham and
  Wycombe have separate commissions of the peace. The administrative county
  contains 230 civil parishes. Buckinghamshire is almost entirely within
  the diocese of Oxford, and 215 ecclesiastical parishes are situated
  wholly or in part within it. There are three parliamentary divisions,
  Northern or Buckingham, Mid or Aylesbury, and Southern or Wycombe, each
  returning one member; and the county contains a small part of the
  parliamentary borough of Windsor (chiefly in Berkshire). The most notable
  institution within the county is Eton College, the famous public school
  founded by Henry VI.</p>
      <p>
         <i>History.</i>—The district which was to become Buckinghamshire
  was reached by the West Saxons in 571, as by a series of victories they
  pushed their way north along the Thames valley. With the grouping of the
  settlements into kingdoms and the consolidation of Mercia under Offa,
  Buckinghamshire was included in Mercia until, with the submission of that
  kingdom to the Northmen, it became part of the Danelaw. In the 10th
  century Buckinghamshire suffered frequently from the ravages of the
  Danes, and numerous barrows and earthworks mark the scenes <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page730">[v.04 p.0730]</ph>of
  struggles against the invaders. These relics are especially abundant in
  the vale of Aylesbury, probably at this time one of the richest and best
  protected of the Saxon settlements. The Chiltern district, on the other
  hand, is said to have been an impassable forest infested by hordes of
  robbers and wild beasts. In the reign of Edward the Confessor, Leofstan,
  12th abbot of St Albans, cut down large tracts of wood in this district
  and granted the manor of Hamstead (Herts) to a valiant knight and two
  fellow-soldiers on condition that they should check the depredations of
  the robbers. The same reason led at an early period to the appointment of
  a steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, and this office being continued long
  after the necessity for it had ceased to exist, gradually became the
  sinecure it is to-day. The district was not finally disforested until the
  reign of James I.</p>
      <p>At the time of the Norman invasion Buckinghamshire was probably
  included in the earldom of Leofwine, son of Godwin, and the support which
  it lent him at the battle of Hastings was punished by sweeping
  confiscations after the Conquest. The proximity of Buckinghamshire to
  London caused it to be involved in most of the great national events of
  the ensuing centuries. During the war between King John and his barons
  William Mauduit held Hanslape Castle against the king, until in 1216 it
  was captured and demolished by Falkes de Bréauté. The county was visited
  severely by the Black Death, and Winslow was one of many districts which
  were almost entirely depopulated. In the civil war Buckinghamshire was
  one of the first counties to join in an association for mutual defence on
  the side of the parliament, which had important garrisons at Aylesbury,
  Brill and elsewhere. Newport Pagnell was for a short time garrisoned by
  the royalist troops, and in 1644 the king fixed his headquarters at
  Buckingham.</p>
      <p>The shire of Buckingham originated with the division of Mercia in the
  reign of Edward the Elder, and was probably formed by the aggregation of
  pre-existing hundreds round the county town, a fact which explains the
  curious irregularities of the boundary line. The eighteen hundreds of the
  Domesday survey have now been reduced to eight, of which the three
  Chiltern hundreds, Desborough, Burnham and Stoke, are unaltered in extent
  as well as in name. The remainder have been formed each by the union of
  three of the ancient hundreds, and Aylesbury is still designated "the
  three hundreds of Aylesbury." All, except Newport and Buckingham, retain
  the names of Domesday hundreds, and the shire has altered little on its
  outer lines since the survey. Until the time of Queen Elizabeth
  Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire had a common sheriff. The shire court of
  the former county was held at Aylesbury.</p>
      <p>The ecclesiastical history of Buckinghamshire is not easy to trace, as
  there is no local chronicler, but the earliest churches were probably
  subject to the West Saxon see of Dorchester, and when after the Conquest
  the bishop's stool was transferred to Lincoln no change of jurisdiction
  ensued. After the dissolution of the monasteries it was proposed to form
  a new diocese to include Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, but the
  project was abandoned, and both remained in the Lincoln diocese until
  1837, when the latter was transferred to Oxford. The arch-deaconry was
  probably founded towards the close of the 11th century by Bishop Rémy,
  and the subdivision into rural deaneries followed shortly after. A dean
  of Thornborough is mentioned in the 12th century, and in the taxation of
  Nicholas IV. eight deaneries are given, comprising 186 parishes. In 1855
  the deaneries were reconstructed and made eighteen in number.</p>
      <p>On the redistribution of estates after the Conquest only two
  Englishmen continued to retain estates of any importance, and the chief
  landowners at this date were Walter Giffard, first earl of Buckingham,
  and Odo, bishop of Bayeux. Few of the great Buckinghamshire estates,
  however, remained with the same proprietors for any length of time. Many
  became annexed by religious establishments, while others reverted to the
  crown and were disposed of by various grants. The family of Hampden alone
  claim to have held the estate from which the name is derived in an
  unbroken line from Saxon times.</p>
      <p>Buckinghamshire has always ranked as an agricultural rather than a
  manufacturing county, and has long been famed for its corn and cattle.
  Fuller mentions the vale of Aylesbury as producing the biggest bodied
  sheep in England, and "Buckinghamshire bread and beef" is an old proverb.
  Lace-making, first introduced into this county by the Fleming refugees
  from the Alva persecution, became a very profitable industry. The
  monopolies of James I. considerably injured this trade, and in 1623 a
  petition was addressed to the high sheriff of Buckinghamshire
  representing the distress of the people owing to the decay of bone
  lace-making. Newport Pagnell and Olney were especially famous for their
  lace, and the parish of Hanslape is said to have made an annual profit of
  £8000 to £9000 from lace manufacture. The straw-plait industry was
  introduced in the reign of George I., and formerly gave employment to a
  large number of the population.</p>
      <p>The county was first represented in parliament by two members in 1290.
  The representation increased as the towns acquired representative rights,
  until in 1603 the county with its boroughs made a total return of
  fourteen members. By the Reform Act of 1832 this was reduced to eleven,
  and by the Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885 the boroughs were deprived
  of representation and the county returned three members for three
  divisions.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Antiquities.</i>—Buckinghamshire contains no ecclesiastical
  buildings of the first rank. Monastic remains are scanty, but two former
  abbeys may be noted. At Medmenham, on the Thames above Marlow, there are
  fragments, incorporated into a residence, of a Cistercian abbey founded
  in 1201; which became notorious in the middle of the 18th century as the
  meeting-place of a convivial club called the "Franciscans" after its
  founder, Sir Francis Dashwood, afterwards Lord le Despencer (1708-1781),
  and also known as the "Hell-Fire Club," of which John Wilkes, Bubb
  Dodington and other political notorieties were members. The motto of the
  club, <i>fay ce que voudras</i> (do what you will), inscribed on a
  doorway at the abbey, was borrowed from Rabelais' description of the
  abbey of Thelema in <i>Gargantua</i>. The remains of the Augustinian
  Notley Abbey (1162), incorporated with a farm-house, deserve mention
  rather for their picturesque situation by the river Thame than for their
  architectural value. Turning to churches, there is workmanship considered
  to be of pre-Norman date in Wing church, in the neighbourhood of Leighton
  Buzzard, including a polygonal apse and crypt. Stewkley church, in the
  same locality, shows the finest Norman work in the county; the building
  is almost wholly of the later part of this period, and the ornamentation
  is very rich. The Early English work of Chetwode and Haddenham churches,
  both in the west of the county, is noteworthy; especially in the first,
  which, as it stands, is the eastern part of a priory church of
  Augustinians (1244). Good specimens of the Decorated style are not
  wanting, though none is of special note; but the county contains three
  fine examples of Perpendicular architecture in Eton College chapel and
  the churches of Maids Moreton to the north, and Hillesden to the south,
  of Buckingham. Ancient domestic architecture is chiefly confined to a few
  country houses, of which Chequers Court, dating from the close of the
  16th century, is of interest not only from the architectural standpoint
  but from its beautiful situation high among the Chiltern Hills between
  Prince's Risborough and Wendover, and from a remarkable collection of
  relics of Oliver Cromwell, preserved here as a consequence of the
  marriage, in 1664, of John Russell, a grandson of the Protector, into the
  family to which the house then belonged. The manor-house of Hampden,
  among the hills east of Prince's Risborough, was for many generations the
  abode of the family of that name, and is still in the possession of
  descendants of John Hampden, who fell at the battle of Chalgrove in 1643,
  and is buried in Hampden church. Fine county seats are
  numerous—there may be mentioned Stowe (Buckingham), formerly the
  seat of the dukes of Buckingham; Cliveden and Hedsor, two among the many
  beautifully situated mansions by the bank of the Thames; and Claydon
  House in the west of the county. Among the Chiltern Hills, also, there
  are several <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page731">[v.04 p.0731]</ph>splendid domains. Associations
  with eminent men have given a high fame to several towns or villages of
  Buckinghamshire. Such are the connexion of Beaconsfield with Edmund
  Waller and Edmund Burke, that of Hughenden near Wycombe with Benjamin
  Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield, whose father's residence was at Bradenham;
  of Olney and Stoke Pogis with the poets Cowper and Gray respectively. At
  Chalfont St Giles a cottage still stands in which Milton completed
  <i>Paradise Lost</i> and began <i>Paradise Regained</i>. In earlier life
  he had lived and worked at Horton, near the Thames below Windsor.</p>
