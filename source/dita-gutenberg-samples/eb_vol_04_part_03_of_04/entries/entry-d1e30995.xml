   <body>
      <p><!--BUCKSTONE, JOHN BALDWIN--> (1802-1879), English actor and dramatic
  writer, was born at Hoxton on the 14th of September 1802. He was articled
  to a solicitor, but soon exchanged the law for the stage. After some
  years as a provincial actor he made his first London appearance, on the
  30th of January 1823, at the Surrey theatre, as Ramsay in the <i>Fortunes
  of Nigel</i>. His success led to his engagement in 1827 at the Adelphi,
  where he remained as leading low comedian until 1833. At the Haymarket,
  which he joined for summer seasons in 1833, and of which he was lessee
  from 1853 to 1878, he appeared as Bobby Trot in his own <i>Luke the
  Labourer</i>; and here were produced a number of his plays and farces,
  <i>Ellen Wareham, Uncle Tom</i> and others. After his return from a visit
  to the United States in 1840 he played at several London theatres, among
  them the Lyceum, where he was Box at the first representation of <i>Box
  and Cox</i>. As manager of the Haymarket he surrounded himself with an
  admirable company, including Sothern and the Kendals. He produced the
  plays of Gilbert, Planch√©, Tom Taylor and Robertson, as well as his own,
  and in most of these he acted. He died on the 31st of October 1879. He
  was the author of 150 plays, some of which have been very popular. His
  daughter, Lucy Isabella Buckstone (1858-1893), was an actress, who made
  her first London appearance at the Haymarket theatre as Ada Ingot in
  <i>David Garrick</i> in 1875.</p>
