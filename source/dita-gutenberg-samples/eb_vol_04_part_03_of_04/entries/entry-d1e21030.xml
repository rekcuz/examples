      <p><!--BROMLEY-->, a municipal borough in the Sevenoaks parliamentary
  division of Kent, England, 10Â½ m. S.E. by S. of London by the South
  Eastern &amp; Chatham railway. Pop. (1901) 27,354. It lies on high ground
  north of the small river Ravensbourne, in a well-wooded district, and has
  become a favourite residential locality for those whose business lies in
  London. The former palace of the bishops of Rochester was erected in 1777
  in room <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page634">[v.04 p.0634]</ph>of an older structure. The manor
  belonged to this see as early as the reign of Ethelbert. In the gardens
  is a chalybeate spring known as St Blaize's Well, which was in high
  repute before the Reformation. The church of St Peter and St Paul, mainly
  Perpendicular, retains a Norman font and other remains of an earlier
  building. Here is the gravestone of the wife of Dr Johnson. Bromley
  College, founded by Bishop Warner in 1666 for "twenty poor widows of
  loyal and orthodox clergymen," has been much enlarged, and forty widows
  are in receipt of support. Sheppard College (1840) is an affiliated
  foundation for unmarried daughters of these widows. In the vicinity of
  Bromley, Bickley is a similar residential township, Hayes Common is a
  favourite place of excursion, and at Holwood Hill near Keston are remains
  of a large encampment known as Caesar's Camp. Bromley was incorporated in
  1903, and is governed by a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors. Area,
  4703 acres.</p>
