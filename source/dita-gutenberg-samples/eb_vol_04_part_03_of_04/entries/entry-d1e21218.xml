   <body>
      <p><!--BRÖNDSTED, PETER OLUF--> (1780-1842), Danish archaeologist and
  traveller, was born at Fruering in Jutland on the 17th of November 1780.
  After studying at the university of Copenhagen he visited Paris in 1806
  with his friend Georg Koes. After remaining there two years, they went
  together to Italy. Both were zealously attached to the study of
  antiquities; and congeniality of tastes and pursuits induced them, in
  1810, to join an expedition to Greece, where they excavated the temples
  of Zeus in Aegina and of Apollo at Bassae in Arcadia. After three years
  of active researches in Greece, Bröndsted returned to Copenhagen, where,
  as a reward for his labours, he was appointed professor of Greek in the
  university. He then began to arrange and prepare for publication the vast
  materials he had collected during his travels; but finding that
  Copenhagen did not afford him the desired facilities, he exchanged his
  professorship for the office of Danish envoy at the papal court in 1818,
  and took up his abode at Rome. In 1820 and 1821 he visited Sicily and the
  Ionian Isles to collect additional materials for his great work. In 1826
  he went to London, chiefly with a view of studying the Elgin marbles and
  other remains of antiquity in the British Museum, and became acquainted
  with the principal archaeologists of England. From 1828-1832 he resided
  in Paris, to superintend the publication of his <i>Travels</i>, and then
  returned to Copenhagen on being appointed director of the museum of
  antiquities and the collection of coins and medals. In 1842 he became
  rector of the university; but a fall from his horse caused his death on
  the 26th of June. His principal work was the <i>Travels and
  Archaeological Researches in Greece</i> (in German and French,
  1826-1830), of which only two volumes were published, dealing with the
  island of Ceos and the metopes of the Parthenon.</p>
