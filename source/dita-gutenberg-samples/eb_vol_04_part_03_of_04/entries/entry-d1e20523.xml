   <title>BROKER</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROKER--> (according to the <i>New English Dictionary</i>, from
  Lat. <i>brocca</i>, spit, spike, <i>broccare</i>, to
  "broach"—another Eng. form of the same word; hence O. Fr. <i>vendre
  à broche</i>, to retail, e.g. wine, from the tap, and thus the general
  sense of dealing; see also for a discussion of the etymology and early
  history of the use of the word, J.R. Dos Passos, <i>Law of
  Stockbrokers</i>, chap. i., New York, 1905). In the primary sense of the
  word, a broker is a mercantile agent, of the class known as general
  agents, whose office is to bring together intending buyers and sellers
  and make a contract between them, for a remuneration called brokerage or
  commission; e.g. cotton brokers, wool brokers or produce brokers.
  Originally the only contracts negotiated by brokers were for the sale or
  purchase of commodities; but the word in its present use includes other
  classes of mercantile agents, such as stockbrokers, insurance-brokers,
  ship-brokers or bill-brokers. Pawnbrokers are not brokers in any proper
  sense of the word; they deal as principals and do not act as agents. In
  discussing the chief questions of modern legal interest in connexion with
  brokers, we shall deal with them, firstly, in the original sense of
  agents for the purchase and sale of goods.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Relations between Broker and Principal.</i>—A broker has not,
  like a factor, possession of his principal's goods, and, unless expressly
  authorized, cannot buy or sell in his own name; his business is to bring
  into privity of contract his principal and the third party. When the
  contract is made, ordinarily he drops out altogether. Brokers very
  frequently act as factors also, but, when they do so, their rights and
  duties as factors must be distinguished from their rights and duties as
  brokers. It is a broker's duty to carry out his principal's instructions
  with diligence, skill and perfect good faith. He must see that the terms
  of the bargain accord with his principal's orders from a commercial point
  of view, e.g. as to quality, quantity and price; he must ensure that the
  contract of sale effected by him be legally enforceable by his principal
  against the third party; and he must not accept any commission from the
  third party, or put himself in any position in which his own interest may
  become opposed to his principal's. As soon as he has made the contract
  which he was employed to make, in most respects his duty to, and his
  authority from, his principal alike cease; and consequently the law of
  brokers relates principally to the formation of contracts by them.</p>
      <p>The most important formality in English law, in making contracts for
  the sale of goods, with which a broker must comply, in order to make the
  contract legally enforceable by his principal against the third party, is
  contained in section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893, which (in substance
  re-enacting section 17 of the Statute of Frauds) provides as
  follows:—"A contract for the sale of any goods of the value of ten
  pounds or upwards shall not be enforceable by action unless the buyer
  shall accept part of the goods as sold, and actually receive the same, or
  give something in earnest to bind the contract, or in part payment, or
  <i>unless some note or memorandum in writing of the contract be made and
  signed by the party to be charged or his agent in that behalf</i>."</p>
      <p>From the reign of James I. till 1884 brokers in London were admitted
  and licensed by the corporation, and regulated by statute; and it was
  common to employ one broker only, who acted as intermediary between, and
  was the agent of both buyer and seller. When the Statute of Frauds was
  passed in the reign of Charles II., it became the practice for the
  broker, acting for both parties, to insert in a formal book, kept for the
  purpose, a memorandum of each contract effected by him, and to sign such
  memorandum on behalf of both parties, in order that there might be a
  written memorandum of the contract of sale, signed by the agent of the
  parties as required by the statute. He would then send to the buyer a
  copy of this memorandum, called the "bought note", and to the seller a
  "sold note", which would run as follows:—</p>
      <fig outputclass="poem">
         <lines>
      "I have this day bought for you from A B [or "my principal"] ..."

      [signed] "M, <i>Broker</i>."

    </lines>

         <lines>
      "I have this day sold for you to A B [or "my principal"] ..."

      [signed] "M, <i>Broker</i>."

    </lines>
      </fig>
      <p>There was in the earlier part of the 19th century considerable
  discussion in the courts as to whether the entry in a broker's book, or
  the bought and sold notes (singly or together), constituted the statutory
  memorandum; and judicial opinion was not unanimous on the point. But at
  the present day brokers are no longer regulated by statute, either in
  London or elsewhere, and keep no formal book; and as an entry made in a
  private book kept by the broker for another purpose, even if signed,
  would probably not be regarded as a memorandum signed by the agent of the
  parties in that behalf, the old discussion is now of little practical
  interest.</p>
      <p>Under modern conditions of business the written memorandum of the
  contract of sale effected by the broker is usually to be found in a
  "contract note"; but the question whether, in the particular
  circumstances of each case, the contract note affords a sufficient
  memorandum in writing, depends upon a variety of
  considerations—e.g. whether the transaction is effected through one
  or through two brokers; whether the contract notes are rendered by one
  broker only, or by both; and, if the latter, whether exchanged between
  the brokers, or rendered by each broker to his own client; for under
  present practice any one of these methods may obtain, according to the
  trade in which the transaction is effected, and the nature of the
  particular transaction.</p>
      <p>Where one and the same broker is employed by both seller and buyer,
  bought and sold notes rendered in the old form provide the necessary
  memorandum of the contract. Where two brokers are employed, one by the
  seller and one by the buyer, sometimes one drops out as soon as the terms
  are negotiated, and the other makes out, signs and sends to the parties
  the bought and sold notes. The latter then becomes the agent of both
  parties for the purpose of signing the statutory memorandum, and the
  position is the same as if one broker only had been employed. On the
  other hand, if one broker does not drop out of the transaction, each
  broker remains to the end the agent of his own principal only, and
  neither becomes the agent of the other party for the purpose of signing
  the memorandum. In such a case it is the usual practice for the buyer's
  broker to send to the seller's broker a note of the contract,—"I,
  acting on account of A. B. [or, "of my principal,"], have this day bought
  <i>from</i> you, acting on account of C. D. [or, "of your
  principal"],"—and to receive a corresponding note from the seller's
  broker. Thus each of the parties receives through his own agent a
  memorandum signed by the other party's agent. These contract notes are
  usually known as, and serve the purpose of, "bought" and "sold" notes. In
  all the above three cases the broker's duty of compliance with all
  formalities necessary to make the contract of sale legally enforceable is
  performed, <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page630">[v.04 p.0630]</ph>and both parties obtain a written
  memorandum of the contract upon which they can sue.</p>
      <p>The broker, on performing his duty in accordance with the terms upon
  which he is employed, is entitled to be paid his "brokerage." This
  usually takes the form of a percentage, varying according to the nature
  and conditions of the business, upon the total price of the goods bought
  or sold through him. When he guarantees the solvency of the other party,
  he is said to be employed upon <i>del credere</i> terms, and is entitled
  to a higher rate of remuneration. In some trades it is the custom for the
  selling broker to receive payment from the buyer or his broker; and in
  such case it is his duty to account to his principal for the purchase
  money. A broker who properly expends money or incurs liability on his
  principal's behalf in the course of his employment, is entitled to be
  reimbursed the money, and indemnified against the liability. Not having,
  like a factor, possession of the goods, a broker has no lien by which to
  enforce his rights against his principal. If he fails to perform his
  duty, he loses his right to remuneration, reimbursement and indemnity,
  and further becomes liable to an action for damages for breach of his
  contract of employment, at the suit of his principal.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Relations between Broker and Third Party.</i>—A broker who
  signs a contract note <i>as broker</i> on behalf of a principal, whether
  named or not, is not personally liable on the contract to the third
  party. But if he makes the contract in such a way as to make himself a
  party to it, the third party may sue either the broker or his principal,
  subject to the limitation that the third party, by his election to treat
  one as the party to the contract, may preclude himself from suing the
  other. In this respect the ordinary rules of the law of agency apply to a
  broker. Generally, a broker has not authority to receive payment, but in
  trades in which it is customary for him to do so, if the buyer pays the
  seller's broker, and is then sued by the seller for the price by reason
  of the broker having become insolvent or absconded, he may set up the
  payment to the broker as a defence to the action by the broker's
  principal. Brokers may render themselves liable for damages in tort for
  the conversion of the goods at the suit of the true owner if they
  negotiate a sale of the goods for a selling principal who has no title to
  the goods.</p>
      <p>
         <i>The Influence of Exchanges.</i>—The relations between brokers
  and their principals, and also between brokers and third parties as above
  defined, have been to some extent modified in practice by the institution
  since the middle of the 19th century in important commercial centres of
  "Exchanges," where persons interested in a particular trade, whether as
  merchants or as brokers, meet for the transaction of business. By the
  contract of membership of the association in whose hands is vested the
  control of the exchange, every person on becoming a member agrees to be
  bound by the rules of the association, and to make his contracts on the
  market in accordance with them. A governing body or committee elected by
  the members enforces observance of the rules, and members who fail to
  meet their engagements on the market, or to conform to the rules, are
  liable to suspension or expulsion by the committee. All disputes between
  members on their contracts are submitted to an arbitration tribunal
  composed of members; and the arbitrators in deciding the questions
  submitted to them are guided by the rules. A printed book of rules is
  available for reference; and various printed forms of contract suited to
  the various requirements of the business are specified by the rules and
  supplied by the association for the use of members. In order to simplify
  the settlement of accounts between members, particularly in respect of
  "futures," i.e. contracts for future delivery, a weekly or other
  periodical settlement is effected by means of a clearing-house; each
  member paying or receiving in respect of all his contracts which are
  still open, the balance of his weekly "differences," i.e. the difference
  between the contract price and the market price fixed for the settlement,
  or between the last and the present settlement prices.</p>
      <p>As all contracts on the market are made subject to the rules, it
  follows that so far as the rules alter the rights and liabilities
  attached by law, the ordinary law is modified. The most important
  modification in the position of brokers effected by membership of such an
  exchange is due to the rule that as, between themselves, all members are
  principals, on the market no agents are recognized; a broker employed by
  a non-member to buy for him on the market is treated by the rules as
  buying for himself, and is, therefore, personally liable on the contract.
  If it be a contract in futures, he is required to conform to the weekly
  settlement rules. If his principal fails to take delivery, the engagement
  is his and he is required to make good to the member who sold to him any
  difference between the contract and market price at the date of delivery.
  But whilst this practice alters directly the relations of the broker to
  the third party, it also affects or tends to affect indirectly the
  relations of the broker to his own principal. The terms of the contract
  of employment being a matter of negotiation and agreement between them,
  it is open to a broker, if he chooses, to stipulate for particular terms;
  and it is the usual practice of exchanges to supply printed contract
  forms for the use of members in their dealings with non-members who
  employ them as brokers, containing a stipulation that the contract is
  made subject to the rules of the exchange; and frequently also a clause
  that the contract is made with the broker as <i>principal</i>. In
  addition to these express terms, there is in the contract of employment
  the term, implied by law in all trade contracts, that the parties consent
  to be bound by such trade usages as are consistent with the express terms
  of the contract, and reasonable. On executing an order the broker sends
  to his client a contract-note either in the form of the old bought and
  sold notes "I have this day [bought / sold] for you," or, when the
  principal clause is inserted, "I have this day [sold to / bought] from
  you." These are not bought and sold notes proper, for the broker is not
  the agent of the third party for the purpose of signing them as statutory
  memoranda of the sale. But they purport to record the terms of the
  contract of employment, and the principal may treat himself as bound by
  their provisions. Sometimes they are accompanied by a detachable form,
  known as the "client's return contract note," to be filled in, signed and
  returned by the client; but even the "client's return contract note" is
  retained by the client's own broker, and is only a memorandum of the
  terms of employment. The following is a form of contract note rendered by
  a broker to his client for American cotton, bought on the Liverpool
  Cotton Exchange for future delivery. The client's contract note is
  attached to it, and is in precisely corresponding form.</p>
      <lq>

         <p>AMERICAN COTTON</p>

         <p>
            <i>Delivery Contract Note.</i>
         </p>

         <p>Liverpool,................</p>

         <p>M................</p>

         <p>DEAR SIRS,</p>

         <p>We have this day.............. to/from you .............. lb American
  Cotton, net weight, to be contained in .............. American Bales,
  more or less, to be delivered in Liverpool, during .............. on the
  basis of .......... per lb for ............ on the terms of the rules,
  bye-laws, and Clearing House regulations of the Liverpool Cotton
  Association, Limited, whether endorsed hereon or not.</p>

         <p>The contract, of which this is a note, is made between ourselves and
  yourselves, and not by or with any person, whether disclosed or not, on
  whose instructions or for whose benefit the same may have been entered
  into. Yours faithfully,</p>

         <p>...................</p>

         <p>The contract, of which the above is a note, was made on the date
  specified, within the business hours fixed by the Liverpool Cotton
  Association, Limited.</p>

         <p>......... per cent to us.</p>

         <p>Please confirm by signing and returning the contract attached.</p>

      </lq>
      <p>The above form of contract note illustrates the tendency of exchanges
  to alter the relations between the broker and his principal. The object
  of inserting in the printed form the provision that the contract is made
  subject to the rules of the <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page631">[v.04 p.0631]</ph>Liverpool Cotton Association is to
  make those rules binding upon the principal, and if he employs his broker
  upon the basis of the printed form, he does bind himself to any
  modification of the relations between himself and his broker which those
  rules may effect. The object of the principal clause in the above and
  similar printed forms is apparently to entitle the broker to sell to or
  buy from his principal on his own account and not as agent at all, thus
  disregarding the duty incumbent upon him as broker of making for his
  principal a contract with a third party.</p>
      <p>It is not possible, except very generally, to state how far exchanges
  have succeeded in imposing their own rules and usages on non-members, but
  it is probably correct to say that in most cases if the question came
  before the courts, the outside client would be held to have accepted the
  rules of the exchange so far as they did not alter the fundamental duties
  to him of his broker. On the other hand, provisions purporting to entitle
  the broker in disregard of his duties as broker himself to act as
  principal, would be rejected by the courts as radically inconsistent with
  the primary object of the contract of brokerage and, therefore,
  meaningless. But it is undoubtedly too often the practice of brokers who
  are members of exchanges to consider themselves entitled to act as
  principals and sell on their own account to their own clients,
  particularly in futures. The causes of this opinion, erroneously, though
  quite honestly held, are probably to be looked for partly in the habit of
  acting as principal on the market in accordance with the rules, partly in
  the forms of contract notes containing "principal clauses" which they
  send to their clients, and perhaps, also, in the occasional difficulty of
  effecting actual contracts on the market at the time when they are
  instructed so to do.</p>
      <p>A <i>stockbroker</i> is a broker who contracts for the sale of stocks
  and shares. Stockbrokers differ from brokers proper chiefly in that
  stocks and shares are not "goods," and the requirement of a memorandum in
  writing, enacted by the Sale of Goods Act 1893, does not apply. Hence
  actions may be brought by the principals to a contract for the sale of
  stocks and shares although no memorandum in writing exists. For instance,
  the jobber, on failing to recover from the buyer's broker the price of
  shares sold, by reason of the broker having failed and been declared a
  defaulter, may sue the buyer whose "name was passed" by the broker. The
  employment of a stockbroker is subject to the rules and customs of the
  Stock Exchange, in accordance with the principles discussed above, which
  apply to the employment of brokers proper. A custom which is illegal,
  such as the Stock Exchange practice of disregarding Leeman's Act (1867),
  which enacts that contracts for the sale of joint-stock bank shares shall
  be void unless the registered numbers of the shares are stated therein,
  is not binding on the client to the extent of making the contract of sale
  valid. But if a client choose to instruct his broker to buy bank shares
  in accordance with that practice, the broker is entitled to be
  indemnified by his client for money which he pays on his behalf, even
  though the contract of sale so made is unenforceable. For further
  information the reader is referred to the article <ph outputclass="sc">Stock
  Exchange</ph> and to the treatises on stock exchange law.</p>
      <p>An <i>insurance broker</i> is an agent whose business is to effect
  policies of marine insurance. He is employed by the person who has an
  interest to insure, pays the premiums to the underwriter, takes up the
  policy, and receives from the underwriter payment in the event of a loss
  under the policy. By the custom of the trade the underwriter looks solely
  to the broker for payment of premiums, and has no right of action against
  the assured; and, on the other hand, the broker is paid his commission by
  the underwriter, although he is employed by the assured. Usually the
  broker keeps a current account with the underwriter, and premiums and
  losses are dealt with in account. It is only in the event of the
  underwriter refusing to pay on a loss, that the broker drops out and the
  assured sues the underwriter direct. Agents who effect life, fire or
  other policies, are not known as insurance brokers.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Ship-brokers</i> are, firstly, "commission agents," and, secondly,
  very often also ships' managers. Their office is to act as agents for
  owners of ships to procure purchasers for ships, or ships for intending
  purchasers, in precisely the same manner as house-agents act in respect
  of houses. They also act as agents for ship-owners in finding charterers
  for their ships, or for charterers in finding ships available for
  charter, and in either case they effect the charter-party (see <ph outputclass="sc">Affreightment</ph>).</p>
      <p>Chartering brokers are customarily paid by the ship-owner, when the
  charter-party is effected, whether originally employed by him or by the
  charterer. Charter-parties effected through brokers often contain a
  provision—"<i>2½% on estimated amount of freight to be paid to A B,
  broker, on the signing of this charter-party, and the ship to be
  consigned to him for ship's business at the port of X</i> [inserting the
  name of the port where A B carries on business]." The broker cannot sue
  on the charter-party contract because he is not a party to it, but the
  insertion of the clause practically prevents his right from being
  disputed by the ship-owner. When the broker does the ship's business in
  port, it is his duty to clear her at the customs and generally to act as
  "ship's husband."</p>
      <p>A <i>bill-broker</i> was originally an agent who, for a commission,
  procured for country bankers the discounting of their bills in London.
  But the practice arose of the broker guaranteeing the London banker or
  financier; and finally the brokers ceased to deposit with the London
  bankers the bills they received, and at the present day a bill-broker, as
  a rule, buys bills on his own account at a discount, borrows money on his
  own account and upon his own security at interest, and makes his profit
  out of the difference between the discount and the interest. When acting
  thus the bill-broker is not a broker at all, as he deals as principal and
  does not act as agent.</p>
