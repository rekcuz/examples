      <p><!--BROOM-RAPE,--> known botanically as <i>Orobanche</i>, a genus of
  brown leafless herbs growing attached to the roots of other plants from
  which they derive their nourishment. The usually stout stem bears
  brownish scales, and ends in a spike of yellow, reddish-brown or purplish
  flowers, with a gaping two-lipped corolla. Several species occur in the
  British Isles; the largest, <i>Orobanche major</i>, is parasitic on roots
  of shrubby leguminous plants, and has a stout stem 1 to 2 ft. high.</p>
