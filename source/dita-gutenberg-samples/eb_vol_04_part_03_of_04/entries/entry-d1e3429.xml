   <title>BRICKFIELDER</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRICKFIELDER,--> a term used in Australia for a hot scorching wind
  blowing from the interior, where the sandy wastes, bare of vegetation in
  summer, are intensely heated by the sun. This hot wind blows strongly,
  often for several days at a time, defying all attempts to keep the dust
  down, and parching all vegetation. It is in one sense a healthy wind, as,
  being exceedingly dry and hot, it destroys many injurious germs of
  disease. The northern brickfielder is almost invariably followed by a
  strong "southerly buster," cloudy and cool from the ocean. The two winds
  are due to the same cause, viz. a cyclonic system over the Australian
  Bight. These systems frequently extend inland as a narrow V-shaped
  depression (the apex northward), bringing the winds from the north on
  their eastern sides and from the south on their western. Hence as the
  narrow system passes eastward the wind suddenly changes from north to
  south, and the thermometer has been known to fall fifteen degrees in
  twenty minutes.</p>
