   <body>
      <p><!--BUCKRAM--> (a word common, in various early forms, to many
  European languages, as in the Fr. <i>bouqueran</i> or Ital.
  <i>bucherame</i>, the derivation of which is unknown), in early usage the
  name of a fine linen or cotton cloth, but now only of a coarse fabric of
  linen or cotton stiffened with glue or other substances, used for linings
  of clothes and in bookbinding. Falstaff's "men in buckram" (Shakespeare,
  <i>Henry IV.</i>, pt. i. II. 4) has become a proverbial phrase for any
  imaginary persons.</p>
