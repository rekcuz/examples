   <title>BRESSE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRESSE,--> a district of eastern France embracing portions of the
  departments of Ain, Saône-et-Loire and Jura. The Bresse extends from the
  Dombes on the south to the river Doubs on the north, and from the Saône
  eastwards to the Jura, measuring some 60 m. in the former, and 20 m. in
  the latter direction. It is a plain varying from 600 to 800 ft. above the
  sea, with few eminences and a slight inclination westwards. Heaths and
  coppice alternate with pastures and arable land; pools and marshes are
  numerous, especially in the north. Its chief rivers are the Veyle, the
  Reyssouze and the Seille, all tributaries of the Saône. The soil is a
  gravelly clay but moderately fertile, and cattle-raising is largely
  carried on. The region is, however, more especially celebrated for its
  table poultry. The inhabitants preserve a distinctive but almost obsolete
  costume, with a curious head-dress. The Bresse proper, called the
  <i>Bresse Bressane</i>, comprises the northern portion of the department
  of Ain. The greater part of the district belonged in the middle ages to
  the lords of Bâgé, from whom it passed in 1272 to the house of Savoy. It
  was not till the first half of the 15th century that the province, with
  Bourg as its capital, was founded as such. In 1601 it was ceded to France
  by the treaty of Lyons, after which it formed (together with the province
  of Bugey) first a separate government and afterwards part of the
  government of Burgundy.</p>
