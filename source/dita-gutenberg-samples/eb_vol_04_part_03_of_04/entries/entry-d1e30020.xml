      <p><!--BUCKIE,--> a fishing town and police burgh of Banffshire,
  Scotland, on the Moray Firth, at the mouth of Buckie burn, about 17 m. W.
  of Banff, with a station on the Great North of Scotland railway. Pop.
  (1891) 5849; (1901) 6549. Its public buildings include a hall and
  literary institute with library and recreation rooms. It attracts one of
  the largest Scottish fleets in the herring season, and is also the chief
  seat of line fishing in Scotland. The harbour, with an outer and an inner
  basin, covers an area of 9 acres and has half a mile of quayage. Besides
  the fisheries, there are engineering works, distilleries, and works for
  the making of ropes, sails and oil. The burn, which divides the town into
  Nether Buckie and Eastern Buckie, rises near the Hill of Clashmadin,
  about 5 m. to the south-west. Portgordon, 1Â½ m. west of Buckie, is a
  thriving fishing village, and Rathven, some 2 m. east, lies in a fertile
  district, where there are several interesting Danish cairns and other
  relics of the remote past.</p>
