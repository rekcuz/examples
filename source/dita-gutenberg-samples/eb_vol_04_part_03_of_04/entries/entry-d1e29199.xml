   <title>BUCHANAN, CLAUDIUS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCHANAN, CLAUDIUS--> (1766-1815), English divine, was born at
  Cambuslang, near Glasgow, and educated at the universities of Glasgow and
  Cambridge. He was ordained in 1795, and after holding a chaplaincy in
  India at Barrackpur (1797-1799) was appointed Calcutta chaplain and
  vice-principal of the college of Fort William. In this capacity he did
  much to advance Christianity and native education in India, especially by
  organizing systematic translations of the Scriptures. An account of his
  travels in the south and west of India, which added considerably to our
  knowledge of nature life, is given in his <i>Christian Researches in
  Asia</i> (Cambridge, 1811). After his return to England in 1808, he still
  took an active part in matters connected with India, and by his book
  entitled <i>Colonial Ecclesiastical Establishment</i> (London, 1813), he
  assisted in settling the controversy of 1813, which ended in the
  establishment of the Indian episcopate.</p>
