   <title>BUFFALO</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUFFALO,--> a city and port of entry, and the county-seat of Erie
  county, New York, U.S.A., the second city in population in the state, and
  the eighth in the United States, at the E. extremity of Lake Erie, and at
  the upper end of the Niagara river; distant by rail from New York City
  423 m., from Boston 499 m., and from Chicago 540 m.</p>
      <p>The site of the city, which has an area of 42 sq. m., is a broad,
  undulating tract, rising gradually from the lake to an elevation of from
  50 to 80 ft., its altitude averaging somewhat less than 600 ft. above
  sea-level. The high land and temperate climate, and the excellent
  drainage and water-supply systems, make Buffalo one of the most healthy
  cities in the United States, its death-rate in 1900 being 14.8 per
  thousand, and in 1907 15.58. As originally platted by Joseph Ellicott,
  the plan of Buffalo somewhat resembled that of Washington, but the plan
  was much altered and even then not adhered to. Buffalo to-day has broad
  and spacious streets, most of which are lined by trees, and many small
  parks and squares. The municipal park system is one of unusual beauty,
  consisting of a chain of parks with a total area of about 1030 acres,
  encircling the city and connected by boulevards and driveways. The
  largest is Delaware Park, about 365 acres, including a lake of 46½ acres,
  in the north part of the city; the north part of the park was enclosed in
  the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. Adjoining it is the
  Forest Lawn cemetery, in which are monuments to President Millard
  Fillmore, and to the famous Seneca chief Red Jacket (1751-1830), a friend
  of the whites, who was faithful when approached by Tecumseh and the
  Prophet, and warned the Americans of their danger; by many he has been
  considered the greatest orator of his race. Among the other parks are
  Cazenovia Park, Humboldt Park, South Park on the Lake Shore, and "The
  Front" on a bluff overlooking the source of the Niagara river; in the
  last is Fort Porter (named in honour of Peter B. Porter), where the
  United States government maintains a garrison.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Principal Buildings.</i>—Buffalo is widely known for the
  beauty of its residential sections, the houses being for the most part
  detached, set well back from the street, and surrounded by attractive
  lawns. Among the principal buildings are the Federal building, erected at
  a cost of $2,000,000; the city and county hall, costing $1,500,000, with
  a clock tower 245 ft. high; the city convention hall, the chamber of
  commerce, the builders' exchange, the Masonic temple, two state
  armouries, the Prudential, Fidelity Trust, White and Mutual Life
  buildings, the Teck, Star and Shea's Park theatres, and the Ellicott
  Square building, one of the largest office structures in the world; and,
  in Delaware Park, the Albright art gallery, and the Buffalo Historical
  Society building, which was originally the New York state building
  erected for the Pan-American Exposition held in 1901. Among the social
  clubs the Buffalo, the University, the Park, the Saturn and the Country
  clubs, and among the hotels the Iroquois, Lafayette, Niagara and Genesee,
  may be especially mentioned. There are many handsome churches, including
  St Joseph's (Roman Catholic) and St Paul's (Protestant Episcopal)
  cathedrals, <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page755">[v.04 p.0755]</ph>and Trinity (Protestant
  Episcopal), the Westminster Presbyterian, the Delaware Avenue Baptist,
  and the First Presbyterian churches.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Education.</i>—In addition to the usual high and grammar
  schools, the city itself supports a city training school for teachers,
  and a system of night schools and kindergartens. Here, too, is a state
  normal school. The university of Buffalo (organized in 1845) comprises
  schools of medicine (1845), law (1887), dentistry (1892), and pharmacy
  (1886). Canisius College is a Roman Catholic (Jesuit) institution for men
  (established in 1870 and chartered in 1883), having in 1907 a college
  department and an academic (or high school) department, and a library of
  about 26,000 volumes. Martin Luther Seminary, established in 1854, is a
  theological seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Among the
  best-known schools are the Academy of the Sacred Heart, Buffalo Seminary,
  the Franklin and the Heathcote schools, Holy Angels and St Mary's
  academies, St Joseph's Collegiate Institute, and St Margaret's school for
  girls. The Buffalo public library, founded in 1837, is housed in a fine
  building erected in 1887 (valued at $1,000,000), and contains about
  300,000 books and pamphlets. Other important libraries, with the
  approximate number of their books, are the Grosvenor (founded in 1859),
  for reference (75,000 volumes and 7000 pamphlets); the John C. Lord,
  housed in the building of the Historical Society (10,620); the Law (8th
  judicial district) (17,000); the Catholic Institute (12,000); and the
  library of the Buffalo Historical Society (founded 1862) (26,600), now in
  the handsome building in Delaware Park used as the New York state
  building during the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. The Buffalo Society
  of Natural Sciences has a museum in the public library building.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Public Institutions.</i>—The hospitals and the charitable and
  correctional institutions are numerous and are well administered. Many
  private institutions are richly endowed. Among the hospitals are a state
  hospital for the insane, the Erie county, the Buffalo general, the
  Children's, the United States marine (maintained by the Federal
  government), the German, the Homeopathic, the Women's, the German
  Deaconess and the Riverside hospitals, and the Buffalo hospital of the
  Sisters of Charity. Nurses' training schools are connected with most of
  these. Among the charitable institutions are the Home for the Friendless,
  the Buffalo, St Vincent's and St Joseph's orphan asylums, St John's
  orphan home, St Mary's asylum for widows and foundlings, and the
  Ingleside home for erring women. One of the most noteworthy institutions
  in the city is the Charity Organisation Society, with headquarters in
  Fitch Institute. Founded in 1877, it was the first in the United States,
  and its manifold activities have not only contributed much to the
  amelioration of social conditions in Buffalo, but have caused it to be
  looked to as a model upon which similar institutions have been founded
  elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The first newspaper, the <i>Gazette</i> (a weekly), was established in
  1811 and became the <i>Commercial</i>, a daily, in 1835. The first daily
  was the <i>Courier</i>, established in 1831. There were in 1908 eleven
  daily papers published, three of which were in German and two in Polish.
  The weekly papers include several in German, three in Polish, and one in
  Italian.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Government and Population.</i>—Buffalo is governed under an
  amended city charter of 1896 by which the government is vested in a
  bicameral city council, and a mayor elected for a term of four years. The
  mayor appoints the heads of the principal executive departments (health,
  civil service, parks, police and fire). The city clerk is elected by the
  city council. The municipality maintains several well-equipped public
  baths, and owns its water-supply system, the water being obtained from
  Lake Erie. The city is lighted by electricity generated by the water
  power of Niagara Falls, and by manufactured gas. Gas, obtained by pipe
  lines from the Ohio-Pennsylvania and the Canadian (Welland) natural gas
  fields, is also used extensively for lighting and heating purposes.</p>
      <p>From the first census enumeration in 1820 the population has steadily
  and rapidly increased from about 2000 till it reached 352,387 inhabitants
  in 1900, and 423,715 (20% increase) in 1910. In 1900 there were 248,135
  native-born and 104,252 foreign-born; 350,586 were white and only 1801
  coloured, of whom 1698 were negroes. Of the native-born whites, 155,716
  had either one or both parents foreign-born; and of the total population
  93,256 were of unmixed German parentage. Of the foreign-born population
  36,720 were German, the other large elements in their order of importance
  being Polish, Canadian, Irish, the British (other than Irish). Various
  sections of the poorer part of the city are occupied almost exclusively
  by the immigrants from Poland, Hungary and Italy.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Communications and Commerce.</i>—Situated almost equidistant
  from Chicago, Boston and New York, Buffalo, by reason of its favourable
  location in respect to lake transportation and its position on the
  principal northern trade route between the East and West, has become one
  of the most important commercial and industrial centres in the Union.
  Some fourteen trunk lines have terminals at, or pass through, Buffalo.
  Tracks of a belt line transfer company encircle the city, and altogether
  there are more than 500 m. of track within the limits of Buffalo. Of
  great importance also is the lake commerce. Almost all the great
  steamship transportation lines of the Great Lakes have an eastern
  terminus at Buffalo, which thus has direct passenger and freight
  connexion with Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee and the "Head of
  the Lakes" (Duluth-Superior). With the latter port it is connected by the
  Great Northern Steamship Company, a subsidiary line of the Great Northern
  railway, the passenger service of which is carried on by what are
  probably the largest and finest inland passenger steamships in existence.
  The tonnage of the port of Buffalo is considerably more than 5,000,000
  tons annually. With a water front of approximately 20 m. and with 8 to 10
  m. of wharfs, the shipping facilities have been greatly increased by the
  extensive harbour improvements undertaken by the Federal government.
  These improvements comprise a series of inner breakwaters and piers and
  an outer breakwater of stone and cement, 4 m. in length, constructed at a
  cost of more than $2,000,000. Another artery of trade of great importance
  is the Erie Canal, which here has its western terminus, and whose
  completion (1825) gave the first impetus to Buffalo's commercial growth.
  With the Canadian shore Buffalo is connected by ferry, and by the
  International bridge (from Squaw Island), which cost $1,500,000 and was
  completed in 1873.</p>
      <p>It is as a distributing centre for the manufactured products of the
  East to the West, and for the raw products of the West to the East, and
  for the trans-shipment from lake to rail and vice versa, that Buffalo
  occupies a position of greatest importance. It is one of the principal
  grain and flour markets in the world. Here in 1843 Joseph Dart erected
  the first grain elevator ever constructed. In 1906 the grain elevators
  had a capacity of between twenty and thirty millions of bushels, and
  annual receipts of more than 200,000,000 bushels. The receipts of flour
  approximate 10,000,000 barrels yearly. More than 10,000,000 head of live
  stock are handled in a year in extensive stock-yards (75 acres) at East
  Buffalo; and the horse market is the largest in America. Other important
  articles of commerce are lumber, the receipts of which average
  200,000,000 ft. per annum; fish (15,000,000 lb annually); and iron ore
  and coal, part of which, however, is handled at Tonawanda, really a part
  of the port of Buffalo. Buffalo is the port of entry of Buffalo Creek
  customs district; in 1908 its imports were valued at $6,708,919, and its
  exports at $26,192,563.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Manufactures.</i>—As a manufacturing centre Buffalo ranks
  next to New York among the cities of the state. The manufactures were
  valued in 1900 at $122,230,061 (of which $105,627,182 was the value of
  the factory product), an increase of 22.2% over 1890; value of factory
  product in 1905, $147,377,873. The value of the principal products in
  1900 was as follows: slaughtering and meat packing, $9,631,187 (in 1905
  slaughtering and meat-packing $12,216,433, and slaughtering, not
  including meat-packing, $3,919,940); foundry and machine shop products,
  $6,816,057 (1905, $11,402,855); linseed oil, $6,271,170; cars and shop
  construction, $4,513,333 (1905, $3,609,471); malt liquors, $4,269,973
  (1905, $5,187,216); soap and candles, $3,818,571 (in 1905, soap <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page756">[v.04
  p.0756]</ph>$4,792,915); flour and grist mill products, $3,263,697
  (1905, $9,807,906); lumber and planing mill products, $3,095,760 (1905,
  $4,186,668); clothing, $3,246,723 (1905, $4,231,126); iron and steel
  products, $2,624,547. Other industrial establishments of importance
  include petroleum refineries, ship-yards, brick, stone and lime works,
  saddlery and harness factories, lithographing establishments, patent
  medicine works, chemical works, and copper smelters and refineries. Some
  of the plants are among the largest in existence, notably the Union and
  the Wagner Palace car works, the Union dry docks, the steel plants of the
  Lackawanna Iron and Steel Company, and the Larkin soap factory.</p>

         <i>History.</i>—The first white men to visit the site of Buffalo
  were undoubtedly the adventurous French trappers and various Jesuit
  missionaries. Near here, on the east bank of the Niagara river at the
  mouth of Cayuga Creek, La Salle in 1679 built his ship the "Griffin," and
  at the mouth of the river built Fort Conti, which, however, was burned in
  the same year. In 1687 marquis de Denonville built at the mouth of the
  river a fort which was named in his honour and was the predecessor of the
  fortifications on or near the same site successively called Fort Niagara;
  and the neighbourhood was the scene of military operations up to the
  close of the War of Independence. As early as 1784 the present site of
  the city of Buffalo came to be known as "the Buffalo Creek region" either
  from the herds of buffalo or bison which, according to Indian tradition,
  had frequented the salt licks of the creek, or more probably from an
  Indian chief. A little later, possibly in 1788-1789, Cornelius Winney, an
  Indian trader, built a cabin near the mouth of the creek and thus became
  the first permanent white resident. Slowly other settlers gathered. The
  land was a part of the original Phelps-Gorham Purchase, and subsequently
  (about 1793) came into the possession of the Holland Land Company, being
  part of the tract known as the Holland Purchase. Joseph Ellicott, the
  agent of the company, who has been called the "Father of Buffalo," laid
  out a town in 1801-1802, calling it New Amsterdam, and by this name it
  was known on the company's books until about 1810. The name of Buffalo
  Creek or Buffalo, however, proved more popular; the village became the
  county-seat of Niagara county in 1808, and two years later the town of
  Buffalo was erected. Upon the outbreak of the second war with Great
  Britain, Buffalo and the region about Niagara Falls became a centre of
  active military operations; directly across the Niagara river was the
  British Fort Erie. It was from Buffalo that Lieutenant Jesse D. Elliott
  (1782-1845) made his brilliant capture of the "Detroit" and "Caledonia"
  in October 1812; and on the 30th and 31st of December 1813 the settlement
  was attacked, captured, sacked, and almost completely destroyed by a
  force of British, Canadians and Indians under General Sir Phineas Riall
  (<i>c.</i> 1769-1851). After the cessation of hostilities, however,
  Buffalo, which had been incorporated as a village in 1813, was rapidly
  rebuilt. Its advantages as a commercial centre were early recognized, and
  its importance was enhanced on the opening up of the middle West to
  settlement, when Buffalo became the principal gateway for the lake
  routes. Here in 1818 was rebuilt the "Walk-in-the-Water," the first
  steamboat upon the Great Lakes, named in honour of a famous Wyandot
  Indian chief. In 1825 the completion of the Erie Canal with its western
  terminus at Buffalo greatly increased the importance of the place, which
  now rapidly outstripped and soon absorbed Black Rock, a village adjoining
  it on the N., which had at one time threatened to be a dangerous rival.
  In 1832 Buffalo obtained a city charter, and Dr Ebenezer Johnson
  (1786-1849) was chosen the first mayor. In that year, and again in 1834,
  a cholera epidemic caused considerable loss of life. At Buffalo in 1848
  met the Free-Soil convention that nominated Martin van Buren for the
  presidency and Charles Francis Adams for the vice-presidency. Grover
  Cleveland lived in Buffalo from 1855 until 1884, when he was elected
  president, and was mayor of Buffalo in 1882, when he was elected governor
  of New York state. The Pan-American Exposition, in celebration of the
  progress of the Western hemisphere in the nineteenth century, was held
  there (May 1-November 2, 1901). It was during a reception in the Temple
  of Music on the Exposition grounds that President McKinley was
  assassinated (September 6th); he died at the home of John G. Milburn, the
  president of the Exposition. In the house of Ansley Wilcox here
  Vice-President Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office as president. A
  marble shaft 80 ft. high, in memory of McKinley, has been erected in
  Niagara Square.</p>
