   <title>BUFF</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUFF--> (from Fr. <i>buffle</i>, a buffalo), a leather originally
  made from the skin of the buffalo, now also from the skins of other
  animals, of a dull pale yellow colour, used for making the buffcoat or
  jerkin, a leathern military coat. The old 3rd Foot regiment of the line
  in the British army (now the East Kent Regiment), and the old 78th Foot
  (now 2nd battalion Seaforth Highlanders), are called the "Buffs" and the
  "Ross-shire Buffs" respectively, from the yellow or buff-colour of their
  facings. The term is commonly used now of the colour alone.</p>
