   <title>BRUNEAU, ALFRED</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRUNEAU, ALFRED--> (1857- ), French musical composer, was born in
  Paris. His parents were devoted to music, and he was brought up to play
  the 'cello, being educated at the Paris Conservatoire. He played in
  Pasdeloup's orchestra, and soon began to compose, writing a cantata,
  <i>Geneviève de Paris</i>, at an early age. In 1884 his <i>Ouverture
  héroïque</i> was performed, followed by the choral symphonies,
  <i>Léda</i> (1884), <i>La Belle au bois dormant</i> (1886) and
  <i>Penthésilée</i>. But he is best known as a dramatic composer. In 1887
  his first opera, <i>Kérim</i>, was produced; and in 1891 his successful
  opera <i>Le Rêve</i>, with a libretto founded on Zola's story. Another
  subject from Zola resulted in the opera <i>L'Attaque du moulin</i>
  (1893), and libretti by Zola himself were written for his next operas
  <i>Messidor</i> (1897) and <i>L'Ouragan</i> (1901). Among Bruneau's other
  works may be mentioned his <i>Requiem</i> (1896), and his two collections
  of songs, <i>Lieds de France</i> and <i>Chansons à danser</i>. He was
  decorated with the Legion of Honour in 1895. His musical criticisms,
  published in several volumes, are remarkable for literary quality and
  vigour.</p>
