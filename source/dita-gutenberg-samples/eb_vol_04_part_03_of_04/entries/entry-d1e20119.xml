   <title>BROD</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROD,--> a town of Croatia-Slavonia, in the county of Pozega, on
  the left bank of the river Save, 124 m. by rail S.E. by E. of Agram. Pop.
  (1900) 7310. The principal Bosnian railway here crosses the river, to
  meet the Hungarian system. Brod has thus a considerable transit trade,
  especially in cereals, wine, spirits, prunes and wood. It is sometimes
  called Slavonisch-Brod, to distinguish it from Bosna-Brod, or
  Bosnisch-Brod, across the river. The town owes its name to a ford
  (Servian <i>brod</i>) of the Save, and dates at least from the 15th
  century. Brod was frequently captured and recaptured in the wars between
  Turkey and Austria; and it was here that the Austrian army mustered, in
  1879, for the occupation of Bosnia.</p>
