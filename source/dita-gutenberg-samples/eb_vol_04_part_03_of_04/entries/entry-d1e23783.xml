   <title>BROWN BESS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROWN BESS-->, a name given in the British army to the flintlock
  musket with which the infantry were formerly armed. The term is applied
  generally to the weapon of the 18th and early 19th centuries, and became
  obsolete on the introduction of the rifle. The first part of the name
  derives from the colour of the wooden stock, for the name is found much
  earlier than the introduction of "browning" the barrel of muskets; "Bess"
  may be either a humorous feminine equivalent of the "brown-bill," the old
  weapon of the British infantry, or a corruption of the "buss,"
  <i>i.e.</i> box, in "blunderbuss."</p>
