   <title>BRIZEUX, JULIEN AUGUSTE PÉLAGE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIZEUX, JULIEN AUGUSTE PÉLAGE--> (1803-1858), French poet, was
  born at Lorient (Morbihan) on the 12th of September 1803. He belonged to
  a family of Irish origin, long settled in Brittany, and was educated for
  the law, but in 1827 he produced at the Théâtre Français a one-act verse
  comedy, <i>Racine</i>, in collaboration with Philippe Busoni. A journey
  to Italy in company with Auguste Barbier made a great impression on him,
  and a second visit (1834) resulted in 1841 in the publication of a
  complete translation of the <i>Divina Commedia</i> in <i>terza rima</i>.
  With <i>Primel el Nola</i> (1852) he included poems written under Italian
  influence, entitled <i>Les Ternaires</i> (1841), but in the rustic idyl
  of <i>Marie</i> (1836) turned to Breton country life; in <i>Les
  Bretons</i> (1845) he found his inspiration in the folklore and legends
  of his native province, and in <i>Telen-Aroor</i> (1844) he used the
  Breton dialect. His <i>Histoires poétiques</i> (1855) was crowned by the
  French Academy. His work is small in bulk, but is characterized by
  simplicity and sincerity. Brizeux was an ardent student of the philology
  and archaeology of Brittany, and had collected materials for a dictionary
  of Breton place-names He died at Montpellier on the 3rd of May 1858.</p>
      <p>His <i>Œuvres complètes</i> (2 vols., 1860) were edited with a
  notice of the author by Saint-René Taillandier. Another edition appeared
  in 1880-1884 (4 vols.). A long list of articles on his work may be
  consulted in an exhaustive monograph, <i>Brizeux; sa vie et ses
  œuvres</i> (1898), by the abbé C. Lecigne.</p>
