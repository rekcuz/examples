      <p><!--BRIDEWELL,--> a district of London between Fleet Street and the
  Thames, so called from the well of St Bride or St Bridget close by. From
  William the Conqueror's time, a castle or Norman tower, long the
  occasional residence of the kings of England, stood there by the Fleet
  ditch. Henry VIII., Stow says, built there "a stately and beautiful
  house," specially for the housing of the emperor Charles V. and his suite
  in 1525. During the hearing of the divorce suit by the Cardinals at
  Blackfriars, Henry and Catharine of Aragon lived there. In 1553 Edward
  VI. made it over to the city as a penitentiary, a house of correction for
  vagabonds and loose women; and it was formally taken possession of by the
  lord mayor and corporation in 1555. The greater part of the building was
  destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666. New Bridewell, built in 1829, was
  pulled down in 1864. The term has become a synonym for any
  reformatory.</p>
