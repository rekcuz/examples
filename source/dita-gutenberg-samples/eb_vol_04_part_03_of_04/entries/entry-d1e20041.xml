   <title>BROCKHAUS, FRIEDRICH ARNOLD</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROCKHAUS, FRIEDRICH ARNOLD--> (1772-1823), German publisher, was
  born at Dortmund, on the 4th of May 1772. He was educated at the
  gymnasium of his native place, and from 1788 to 1793 served an
  apprenticeship in a mercantile house at Düsseldorf. He then devoted two
  years at Leipzig to the study of modern languages and literature, after
  which he set up at Dortmund an emporium for English goods. In 1801 he
  transferred this business to Arnheim, and in the following year to
  Amsterdam. In 1805, having given up his first line of trade, he began
  business as a publisher. Two journals projected by him were not allowed
  by the government to survive for any length of time, and in 1810 the
  complications in the affairs of Holland induced him to return homewards.
  In 1811 he settled at Altenburg. About three years previously he had
  purchased the copyright of the <i>Konversations-Lexikon</i>, started in
  1796, and in 1810-1811 he completed the first edition of this celebrated
  work (14th ed. 1901-4). A second edition under his own editorship was
  begun in 1812, and was received with universal favour. His business
  extended rapidly, and in 1818 Brockhaus removed to Leipzig, where he
  established a large printing-house. Among the more extensive of his many
  literary undertakings were the critical periodicals—<i>Hermes</i>,
  the <i>Literarisches Konversationsblatt</i> (afterwards the <i>Blätter
  für literarische Unterhaltung</i>), and the <i>Zeitgenossen</i>, and some
  large historical and bibliographical works, such as Raumer's
  <i>Geschichte der Hohenstaufen</i>, and Ebert's <i>Allgemeines
  bibliographisches Lexikon</i>. F.A. Brockhaus died at Leipzig on the 20th
  of August 1823. The business was carried on by his sons, Friedrich
  Brockhaus (1800-1865) who retired in 1850, and Heinrich Brockhaus
  (1804-1874), under whom it was considerably extended. The latter
  especially rendered great services to literature and science, which the
  university of Jena recognized by making him, in 1858, honorary doctor of
  philosophy. In the years 1842-1848, Heinrich Brockhaus was member of the
  Saxon second chamber, as representative for Leipzig, was made honorary
  citizen of that city in 1872, and died there on the 15th of November
  1874.</p>

      <p>Another of Friedrich's sons, <ph outputclass="sc">Hermann Brockhaus</ph>
  (1806-1877), German Orientalist, was born at Amsterdam on the 28th of
  January 1806. While his two brothers carried on the business he devoted
  himself to an academic career. He was appointed extraordinary professor
  in Jena in 1838, and in 1841 received a call in a similar capacity to
  Leipzig, where in 1848 he was made ordinary professor of ancient Semitic.
  He died at Leipzig on the 5th of January 1877. Brockhaus was an Oriental
  scholar in the old sense of the word, devoting his attention, not to one
  language only, but to acquiring a familiarity with the principal
  languages and literature of the East. He studied Hebrew, Arabic and
  Persian, and was able to lecture on Sanskrit, afterwards his specialty,
  Pali, Zend and even on Chinese. His most important work was the <i>editio
  princeps</i> of the <i>Katha-sarit-sagara</i>, "The Ocean of the Streams
  of Story," the large collection of Sanskrit stories made by Soma Deva in
  the 12th century. By this publication he gave the first impetus to a
  really scientific study of the origin and spreading of popular tales, and
  enabled Prof. Benfey and others to trace the great bulk of Eastern and
  Western stories to an Indian, and more especially to a Buddhistic source.
  Among Prof. Brockhaus's other publications were his edition of the
  curious philosophical play <i>Prabodhachandrodaya</i>, "The Rise of the
  Moon of Intelligence," his critical edition of the "Songs of Hafiz," and
  his publication in Latin letters of the text of the "Zend-Avesta."</p>
