   <title>BROCADE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROCADE-->, the name usually given to a class of richly decorative
  shuttle-woven fabrics, often made in coloured silks and with or without
  gold and silver threads. Ornamental features in brocade are emphasized
  and wrought as additions to the main fabric, sometimes stiffening it,
  though more frequently producing on its face the effect of low relief.
  These additions present a distinctive appearance on the back of the stuff
  where <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page621">[v.04

  parts hang in loose groups or are clipped away.</p>

    Along the top is the Kufic inscription "Arrahmān" (The Merciful)
    several times repeated in olive green on a gold-thread ground. Pairs of
    seated animals, <i>addorsed regardant</i> and geese <i>vis-à-vis</i>
    are worked within the lozenge-shaped compartments of the trellis
    framework which regulates the pattern. Both animals and birds are
    separated by conventional trees, and the latter are enclosed in
    inscriptions of Kufic characters. <i>Siculo-Saracenic</i>; 11th or 12th

      <p>The Latin word <i>broccus</i> is related equally to the Italian
  <i>brocato</i>, the Spanish <i>brocar</i> and the French <i>brocarts</i>
  and <i>brocher</i>, and implies a form of stitching or broaching, so that
  textile fabrics woven with an appearance of stitching or broaching have
  consequently come to be termed "brocades." A Spanish document dated 1375
  distinguishes between <i>los draps d'or é d'argent o de seda</i> and
  <i>brocats d'or é d'argent</i>, a difference which is readily perceived,
  upon comparing for instance cloths of gold, Indian kincobs, with Lyons
  silks that are <i>brochés</i> with threads of gold, silk or other
  material. Notwithstanding this, many Indian kincobs and dainty gold and
  coloured silk-weavings of Persian workmanship, both without floating
  threads, are often called brocades, although in neither is the
  ornamentation really <i>broché</i> or brocaded. Contemporary in use with
  the Spanish <i>brocats</i> is the word <i>brocado</i>. In addition to
  <i>brocarts</i> the French now use the word <i>brocher</i> in connexion
  with certain silk stuffs which however are not brocades in the same sense
  as the <i>brocarts</i>. A wardrobe account of King Edward IV. (1480) has
  an entry of "satyn broched with gold"—a description that fairly
  applies to such an enriched satin as that for instance shown in fig. 4.
  But some three centuries earlier than the date of that specimen,
  decorative stuffs were partly <i>brochés</i> with gold threads by
  oriental weavers, especially those of Persia, Syria and parts of southern
  Europe and northern Africa under the domination of the Saracens, to whom
  the earlier germs, so to speak, of brocading may be traced. Of such is
  the 11th or 12th century Siculo-Saracenic specimen in fig. 1, in which
  the heads only of the pairs of animals and birds are broched with gold
  thread. Another sort of brocaded material is indicated in fig. 2, taken
  from a part of a sumptuous Siculo-Saracenic weaving produced in coloured
  silks and gold threads at the famous Hotel des Tiraz in Palermo for an
  official robe of Henry IV. (1165-1197) as emperor of the Holy Roman
  Empire, and still preserved in the cathedral of Regensburg. Fig. 3 is a
  further variety of textile that would be classed as <i>brocat</i>. This
  is of the 12th or 13th century manufacture, possibly by German or
  Rhenish-Byzantine weavers, or even by Spanish weavers, many of whom at
  Almeria, Malaga, Grenada and Seville rivalled those at Palermo. In the
  14th century the making of satins heavily brocaded with gold threads was
  associated conspicuously with such Italian towns as Lucca, Genoa, Venice
  and Florence. Fig. 4 is from a piece of 14th-century dark-blue satin
  broached in relief with gold thread in a design the like of which appears
  in the background of Orcagna's "Coronation of the Virgin," now in the
  National Gallery, London. During the 17th century Genoa, Florence and
  Lyons vied with each other in making brocades in which the enrichments
  were as frequently of coloured silks as of gold intermixed with silken
  threads. Fig. 5 is from a piece of crimson silk damask flatly brocaded
  with flowers, scroll forms, fruit and birds in gold. This is probably of
  Florentine workmanship. Rather more closely allied to modern brocades is
  the Lyons specimen given in fig. 6, in which the brocading is done not
  only with silver but also with coloured silks. Early in the 18th century
  Spitalfields was busy as a competitor with Lyons in manufacturing many
  sorts of brocades, specified in a collection of designs preserved in the
  national art library of the Victoria and <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page622">[v.04 p.0622]</ph>Albert Museum,
  under such trade titles as "brocade lutstring, brocade tabby, brocade
  tissue, brocade damask, brocade satin, Venetian brocade, and India
  figured brocade." Brocading in China seems to be of considerable
  antiquity, and Dr Bushell in his valuable handbook on Chinese art cites a
  notice of five rolls of brocade with dragons woven upon a crimson ground,
  presented by the emperor Ming Ti of the Wei dynasty, in the year <ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph> 238, to the reigning empress of Japan; and
  varieties of brocade patterns are recorded as being in use during the
  Sung dynasty (960-1279). The first edition of an illustrated work upon
  tillage and weaving was published in China in 1210, and contains an
  engraving of a loom constructed to weave flowered-silk brocades such as
  are woven at the present time at Suchow and Hangchow and elsewhere. On
  the other hand, although they are described usually as brocades, certain
  specimens of imperial Chinese robes sumptuous in ornament, sheen of
  coloured silks and the glisten of golden threads, are woven in the
  tapestry-weaving manner and without any floating threads. It seems
  reasonable to infer that Persians and Syrians derived the art of weaving
  brocades from the Chinese, and as has been indicated, passed it on to
  Saracens as well as Europeans.</p>
