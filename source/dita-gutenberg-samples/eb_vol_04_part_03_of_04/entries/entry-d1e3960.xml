   <body>
      <p><!--BRICOLE--> (a French word of unknown origin), a military engine
  for casting heavy stones; also a term in tennis for a sidestroke
  rebounding off the wall of the court, corrupted into "brickwall" from a
  supposed reference to the wall, and in billiards for a stroke off the
  cushion to make a cannon or hazard.</p>
