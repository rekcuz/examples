   <body>
      <p><!--BRZOZOWSKI, THADDEUS--> (d. 1820), nineteenth general of the
  Jesuits, was appointed in succession to Gabriel Gruber on the 2nd of
  September 1805. In 1801 Pius VII. had given the Jesuits liberty to
  reconstitute themselves in north Russia (see <ph outputclass="sc">Jesuits</ph>: <i>History</i>), and in 1812 Brzozowski
  secured the recognition of the Jesuit college of Polotsk as a university,
  though he could not obtain permission to go to Spain to agitate for the
  recognition <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page709">[v.04 p.0709]</ph>of the Spanish Jesuits. In 1814
  Pius VII., in accordance with the bull <i>Sollicitudo omnium
  ecclesiarum</i>, gave to Brzozowski among others full authority to
  receive those who desired to enter the society. The Russian government,
  however, soon began to be alarmed at the growth of the Jesuits, and on
  the 20th of December 1815 published an edict expelling them from St
  Petersburg. Brzozowski, having vainly requested to be allowed to retire
  to Rome, died on the 5th of February 1820. He is interesting mainly from
  the fact that he was general of the Society at the time of its
  restoration throughout Europe.</p>
