      <p><!--BRUNSWICK-BEVERN, AUGUST WILHELM,--> <ph outputclass="sc">Duke
  of</ph> (1715-1781), Prussian soldier, son of Ernst Ferdinand, duke of
  Brunswick-Bevern, was born at Brunswick in 1715, and entered the Prussian
  army in 1731, becoming colonel of an infantry regiment in 1739. He won
  great distinction at Hohenfriedeberg as a major-general, and was promoted
  lieutenant-general in 1750. He was one of the most experienced and exact
  soldiers in the army of Frederick the Great. He commanded a wing in the
  battle of Lobositz in 1756, and defeated the Austrians under Marshal
  Konigsegg in a well-fought battle at Reichenberg on the 21st of April
  1757. He took part in the battles of Prague and Kolin and the retreat to
  GÃ¶rlitz, and subsequently commanded the Prussians left behind by
  Frederick in the autumn of 1757 when he marched against the French.
  Bevern conducted a defensive campaign against overwhelming numbers with
  great skill, but he soon lost the valuable assistance of General
  Winterfeld, who was killed in a skirmish at Moys; and he was eventually
  brought to battle and suffered a heavy defeat at Breslau on the 22nd of
  November. He fell into the hands of the Austrians on the following
  morning, and remained prisoner for a year. He was made general of
  infantry in 1759, and on the 11th of August 1762 inflicted a severe
  defeat at Reichenbach on an Austrian army endeavouring to relieve
  Schweidnitz. Bevern retired, after the peace of Hubertusburg, to his
  government of Stettin, where he died in 1781.</p>
