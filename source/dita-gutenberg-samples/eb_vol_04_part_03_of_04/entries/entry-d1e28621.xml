   <title>BUCCANEERS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCCANEERS,--> the name given to piratical adventurers of
  different nationalities united in their opposition to Spain, who
  maintained themselves chiefly in the Caribbean Sea during the 17th
  century.</p>
      <p>The island of Santo Domingo was one of several in the West Indies
  which had early in the 16th century been almost depopulated by the
  oppressive colonial policy of Spain. Along its coast there were several
  isolated establishments presided over by Spaniards, who were deprived of
  a convenient market for the produce of the soil by the monopolies imposed
  by the mother country. Accordingly English, Dutch and French vessels were
  welcomed and their cargoes readily bought. The island, thinned of its
  former inhabitants, had become the home of immense herds of wild cattle;
  and it became the habit of smugglers to provision at Santo Domingo. The
  natives still left were skilled in preserving flesh at their little
  establishments called <i>boucans</i>. The adventurers learned
  "boucanning" from the natives; and gradually Hispaniola became the scene
  of an extensive and illicit butcher trade. Spanish monopolies filled the
  seamen who sailed the Caribbean with a natural hate of everything
  Spanish. The pleasures of a roving life, enlivened by occasional
  skirmishes with forces organized and led by Spanish officials, gained
  upon them. Out of such conditions arose the buccaneer, alternately sailor
  and hunter, even occasionally a planter—roving, bold, unscrupulous,
  often savage, with an intense detestation of Spain. As the Spaniards
  would not recognize the right of other races to make settlements, or even
  to trade in the West Indies, the governments of France, England and
  Holland would do nothing to control their subjects who invaded the
  islands. They left them free to make settlements at their own risk. Each
  nation contributed a band of colonists, who selected the island of St
  Kitts or St Christopher, in the West Indies, where the settlers of both
  nations were simultaneously planted. The English and French were,
  however, not very friendly; and in 1629, after the retirement of several
  of the former to an adjoining island, the remaining colonists were
  surprised and partly dispersed by the arrival of a Spanish fleet of
  thirty-nine sail. But on the departure of the fleet the scattered bands
  returned, and encouragement was given to their countrymen in Santo
  Domingo. For buccaneering had now become a most profitable employment,
  operations were extended, and a storehouse secure from the attacks of the
  Spaniards was required. The small island of Tortuga (north-west of
  Hispaniola) was seized for this purpose in 1630, converted into a
  magazine for the goods of the rivals, and made their headquarters, Santo
  Domingo itself still continuing their hunting ground. A purely English
  settlement directed by a company in London was made at Old Providence, an
  island in the Caribbean Sea, now belonging to Colombia. It began a little
  before 1630, and was suppressed by the Spaniards in 1641.</p>
      <p>Spain was unable to take immediate action. Eight years later, however,
  watching their opportunity when many buccaneers were absent in the larger
  island, the Spaniards attacked Tortuga, and massacred every settler they
  could seize. But the others returned; and the buccaneers, now in open
  hostility to the Spanish arms, began to receive recruits from every
  European trading nation, and for three-quarters of a century became the
  scourge of the Spanish-American trade and dominions.</p>
      <p>France, throughout all this, had not been idle. She had named the
  governor of St Kitts "Governor-General for the French West India
  Islands," and in 1641 he took possession of Tortuga, expelled all English
  from the island, and attempted the same with less success in Santo
  Domingo. England was absorbed in the Civil War, and the buccaneers had to
  maintain themselves as best they could,—now mainly on the sea.</p>
      <p>In 1654 the Spaniards regained Tortuga from the French, into whose
  hands it again, however, fell after six years. But this state of affairs
  was too insecure even for these rovers, and they would speedily have
  succumbed had not a refuge been found for them by the fortunate conquest
  of Jamaica in 1655 by the navy of the English Commonwealth. These
  conquests were not made without the aid of the buccaneers themselves. The
  taking and re-taking of Tortuga by the French was always with the
  assistance of the roving community; and at the conquest of Jamaica the
  English navy had the same influence in its favour. The <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page710">[v.04
  p.0710]</ph>buccaneers, in fact, constituted a mercenary navy, ready
  for employment against the power of Spain by any other nation, on
  condition of sharing the plunder; and they were noted for their daring,
  their cruelty and their extraordinary skill in seamanship.</p>
      <p>Their history now divides itself into three epochs. The first of these
  extends from the period of their rise to the capture of Panama by Morgan
  in 1671, during which time they were hampered neither by government aid
  nor, till near its close, by government restriction. The second, from
  1671 to the time of their greatest power, 1685, when the scene of their
  operations was no longer merely the Caribbean, but principally the whole
  range of the Pacific from California to Chile. The third and last period
  extends from that year onwards; it was a time of disunion and
  disintegration, when the independence and rude honour of the previous
  periods had degenerated into unmitigated vice and brutality.</p>
      <p>It is chiefly during the first period that those leaders flourished
  whose names and doings have been associated with all that was really
  influential in the exploits of the buccaneers—the most prominent
  being Mansfield and Morgan. The floating commerce of Spain had by the
  middle of the 17th century become utterly insignificant. But Spanish
  settlements remained; and in 1654 the first great expedition on land made
  by the buccaneers, though attended by considerable difficulties, was
  completed by the capture and sack of New Segovia, on the mainland of
  America. The Gulf of Venezuela, with its towns of Maracaibo and
  Gibraltar, were attacked and plundered under the command of a Frenchman
  named L'Ollonois, who performed, it is said, the office of executioner
  upon the whole crew of a Spanish vessel manned with ninety seamen. Such
  successes removed the buccaneers further and further from the pale of
  civilized society, fed their revenge, and inspired them with an avarice
  almost equal to that of the original settlers from Spain. Mansfield
  indeed, in 1664, conceived the idea of a permanent settlement upon a
  small island of the Bahamas, named New Providence, and Henry Morgan, a
  Welshman, intrepid and unscrupulous, joined him. But the untimely death
  of Mansfield nipped in the bud the only rational scheme of settlement
  which seems at any time to have animated this wild community; and Morgan,
  now elected commander, swept the whole Caribbean, and from his
  headquarters in Jamaica led triumphant expeditions to Cuba and the
  mainland. He was leader of the expedition wherein Porto Bello, one of the
  best-fortified ports in the West Indies, was surprised and plundered.</p>
      <p>This was too much for even the adverse European powers; and in 1670 a
  treaty was concluded between England and Spain, proclaiming peace and
  friendship among the subjects of the two sovereigns in the New World,
  formally renouncing hostilities of every kind. Great Britain was to hold
  all her possessions in the New World as her own property (a remarkable
  concession on the part of Spain), and consented, on behalf of her
  subjects, to forbear trading with any Spanish port without licence
  obtained.</p>
      <p>The treaty was very ill observed in Jamaica, where the governor,
  Thomas Modyford (1620-1679), was in close alliance with the "privateers,"
  which was the official title of the buccaneers. He had already granted
  commissions to Morgan and others for a great attack on the Isthmus of
  Panama, the route by which the bullion of the South American mines was
  carried to Porto Bello, to be shipped to Spain. The buccaneers to the
  number of 2000 began by seizing Chagres, and then marched to Panama in
  1671. After a difficult journey on foot and in canoes, they found
  themselves nearing the shores of the South Sea and in view of the city.
  On the morning of the tenth day they commenced an engagement which ended
  in the rout of the defenders of the town. It was taken, and, accidentally
  or not, it was burnt. The sack of Panama was accompanied by great
  barbarities. The Spaniards had, however, removed the treasure before the
  city was taken. When the booty was divided, Morgan is accused of having
  defrauded his followers. It is certain that the share per man was small,
  and that many of the buccaneers died of starvation while trying to return
  to Jamaica. Modyford was recalled, and in 1672 Morgan was called home and
  imprisoned in the Tower. In 1674 he was allowed to come back to the
  island as lieutenant-governor with Lord Vaughan. He had become so
  unpopular after the expedition of 1671 that he was followed in the
  streets and threatened by the relations of those who had perished. During
  his later years he was active in suppressing the buccaneers who had now
  inconvenient claims on him.</p>
      <p>From 1671 to 1685 is the time of the greatest daring, prosperity and
  power of the buccaneers. The expedition against Panama had not been
  without its influence. Notwithstanding their many successes in the
  Caribbean and on land, including a second plunder of Porto Bello, their
  thoughts ran frequently on the great expedition across the isthmus, and
  they pictured the South Sea as a far wider and more lucrative field for
  the display of their united power.</p>
      <p>In 1680 a body of marauders over 300 strong, well armed and
  provisioned, landed on the shore of Darien and struck across the country;
  and the cruelty and mismanagement displayed in the policy of the
  Spaniards towards the Indians were now revenged by the assistance which
  the natives eagerly rendered to the adventurers. They acted as guides
  during a difficult journey of nine days, kept the invaders well supplied
  with food, provided them with canoes, and only left them after the taking
  of the fort of Santa Maria, when the buccaneers were fairly embarked on a
  broad and safe river which emptied itself into the South Sea. With John
  Coxon as commander they entered the Bay of Panama, where rumour had been
  before them, and where the Spaniards had hastily prepared a small fleet
  to meet them. But the valour of the buccaneers won for them another
  victory; within a week they took possession of four Spanish ships, and
  now successes flowed upon them. The Pacific, hitherto free from their
  intrusion, showed many sail of merchant vessels, while on land opposition
  south of the Bay of Panama was of little avail, since few were acquainted
  with the use of fire-arms. Coxon and seventy men returned as they had
  gone, but the others, under Sawkins, Sharp and Watling, roamed north and
  south on islands and mainland, and remained for long ravaging the coast
  of Peru. Never short of silver and gold, but often in want of the
  necessaries of life, they continued their practices for a little longer;
  then, evading the risk of recrossing the isthmus, they boldly cleared
  Cape Horn, and arrived in the Indies. Again, in 1683, numbers of them
  under John Cook departed for the South Sea by way of Cape Horn. On Cook's
  death his successor, Edward Davis, undoubtedly the greatest and most
  prudent commander who ever led the forces of the buccaneers at sea, met
  with a certain Captain Swan from England, and the two captains began a
  cruise which was disastrous to the Spanish trade in the Pacific.</p>
      <p>In 1685 they were joined in the Bay of Panama by large numbers of
  buccaneers who had crossed the isthmus under Townley and others. This
  increased body of men required an enlarged measure of adventure, and this
  in a few months was supplied by the viceroy of Peru. That officer, seeing
  the trade of the colony cut off, supplies stopped, towns burned and
  raided, and property harassed by continual raids, resolved by vigorous
  means to put an end to it. But his aim was not easily accomplished. In
  this same year a Spanish fleet of fourteen sail met, but did not engage,
  ten buccaneer vessels which were found in the Bay of Panama.</p>
      <p>At this period the power of the buccaneers was at its height. But the
  combination was too extensive for its work, and the different nationality
  of those who composed it was a source of growing discord. Nor was the
  dream of equality ever realized for any length of time. The immense spoil
  obtained on the capture of wealthy cities was indeed divided equally. But
  in the gambling and debauchery which followed, nothing was more common
  than that one-half of the conquerors should find themselves on the morrow
  in most pressing want; and while those who had retained or increased
  their share would willingly have gone home, the others clamoured for
  renewed attacks. The separation of the English and French buccaneers, who
  together presented a united front to the Spanish fleet in 1685, marks the
  beginning of the third and last epoch in their history.</p>
      <p>The brilliant exploits begun by the sack of Leon and Realejo <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page711">[v.04 p.0711]</ph>by
  the English under Davis have, even in their variety and daring, a
  sameness which deprives them of interest, and the wonderful confederacy
  is now seen to be falling gradually to pieces. The skill of Davis at sea
  was on one occasion displayed in a seven days' engagement with two large
  Spanish vessels, and the interest undoubtedly centres in him. Townley and
  Swan had, however, by this time left him, and after cruising together for
  some time, they, too, parted. In 1688 Davis cleared Cape Horn and arrived
  in the West Indies, while Swan's ship, the "Cygnet," was abandoned as
  unseaworthy, after sailing as far as Madagascar. Townley had hardly
  joined the French buccaneers remaining in the South Sea ere he died, and
  the Frenchmen with their companions crossed New Spain to the West Indies.
  And thus the Pacific, ravaged so long by this powerful and mysterious
  band of corsairs, was at length at peace.</p>
      <p>The West Indies had by this time become hot enough even for the banded
  pirates. They hung doggedly along the coasts of Jamaica and Santo
  Domingo, but their day was nearly over. Only once again—at the
  siege of Carthagena—did they appear great; but even then the
  expedition was not of their making, and they were mere auxiliaries of the
  French regular forces. After the treachery of the French commander of
  this expedition a spirit of unity and despairing energy seemed reawakened
  in them; but this could not avert and scarcely delayed the rapidly
  approaching extinction of the community.</p>
      <p>The French and English buccaneers could not but take sides in the war
  which had arisen between their respective countries in 1689. Thus was
  broken the bond of unity which had for three-quarters of a century kept
  the subjects of the two nations together in schemes of aggression upon a
  common foe. In the short peace of 1697-1700 England and France were using
  all their influence, both in the Old World and in the New, to ingratiate
  themselves into the favour of the king of Spain. With the resumption of
  hostilities in 1700 and the rise of Spain consequent upon the accession
  of the French claimant to the throne the career of the buccaneers was
  effectually closed.</p>
      <p>But the fall of the buccaneers is no more accounted for fully by these
  circumstances than is their rise by the massacre of the islanders of
  Santo Domingo. There was that in the very nature of the community which,
  from its birth, marked it as liable to speedy decline.</p>
      <p>The principles which bound the buccaneers together were, first the
  desire for adventure and gain, and, in the second place, hatred of the
  Spaniard. The first was hardly a sufficient bond of union, among men of
  different nationalities, when booty could be had nearly always by private
  venture under the colours of the separate European powers. Of greater
  validity was their second and great principle of union, namely, that they
  warred not with one another, nor with every one, but with a single and a
  common foe. For while the buccaneer forces included English, French and
  Dutch sailors, and were complemented occasionally by bands of native
  Indians, there are few instances during the time of their prosperity and
  growth of their falling upon one another, and treating their fellows with
  the savagery which they exulted in displaying against the subjects of
  Spain. The exigencies, moreover, of their perilous career readily wasted
  their suddenly acquired gains.</p>
      <p>Settled labour, the warrant of real wealth, was unacceptable to those
  who lived by promoting its insecurity. Regular trade—though
  rendered attractive by smuggling—and pearl gathering and similar
  operations which were spiced with risk, were open in vain to them, and in
  the absence of any domestic life, a hand-to-mouth system of supply and
  demand rooted out gradually the prudence which accompanies any mode of
  settled existence. In everything the policy of the buccaneers, from the
  beginning to the end of their career, was one of pure destruction, and
  was, therefore, ultimately suicidal.</p>
      <p>Their great importance in history lies in the fact that they opened
  the eyes of the world, and specially of the nations from whom these
  buccaneers had sprung, to the whole system of Spanish-American government
  and commerce—the former in its rottenness, and the latter in its
  possibilities in other hands. From this, then, along with other causes,
  dating primarily from the helplessness and presumption of Spain, there
  arose the West Indian possessions of Holland, England and France.</p>
      <p>A work published at Amsterdam in 1678, entitled <i>De Americaensche
  Zee Roovers</i>, from the pen of a buccaneer named Exquemelin, was
  translated into several European languages, receiving additions at the
  hands of the different translators. The French translation by
  Frontignières is named <i>Histoire des avanturiers qui se sont signalez
  dans les Indes</i>; the English edition is entitled <i>The Bucaniers of
  America.</i> Other works are Raynal's <i>History of the Settlements and
  Trade of the Europeans in the East and West Indies</i>, book x., English
  translation 1782; Dampier's <i>Voyages</i>; Geo. W. Thornbury's
  <i>Monarchs of the Main, &amp;c.</i> (1855); Lionel Wafer's <i>Voyage and
  Description of the Isthmus of America</i> (1699); and the <i>Histoire de
  l'isle Espagnole, &amp;c.</i>, and <i>Histoire et description générale de
  la Nouvelle France</i> of Père Charlevoix. The statements in these works
  are to be received with caution. A really authentic narrative, however,
  is Captain James Burney's <i>History of the Buccaneers of America</i>
  (London, 1816). The <i>Calendar of State Papers</i>, Colonial Series
  (London, 1860 et seq.), contains much evidence for the history of the
  buccaneers in the West Indies.</p>
