   <title>BROCKEN</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROCKEN,--> a mountain of Germany, in Prussian Saxony, the highest
  point (3733 ft.) of the Harz. It is a huge, bare, granite-strewn,
  dome-shaped mass and, owing to its being the greatest elevation in north
  Germany, commands magnificent views in all directions. From it Magdeburg
  and the Elbe, the towers of Leipzig and the Thuringian forest are
  distinctly visible in clear weather. Access to the summit is attained by
  a mountain railway (12 m.) from Dreiannen-Hohne, a station on the normal
  gauge line Wernigerode-Nordhausen, and by two carriage roads from the
  Bodetal and Ilsenburg respectively. In the folklore of north Germany the
  Brocken holds an important place, and to it cling many legends. Long
  after Christianity had penetrated to these regions, the Brocken remained
  a place of heathen worship. Annually, on Walpurgis night (1st of May),
  curious rites were here enacted, which, condemned by the priests of the
  Christian church, led to the belief that the devil and witches here held
  their orgies. Even to this day, this superstition possesses the minds of
  many country people around, who believe the mountain to be haunted on
  this night. In literature <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page624">[v.04 p.0624]</ph>it is represented by the famous
  "Brocken scene" in Goethe's <i>Faust</i>.</p>

  and Pr√∂hle, <i>Brockensagen</i> (Magdeburg, 1888).</p>
