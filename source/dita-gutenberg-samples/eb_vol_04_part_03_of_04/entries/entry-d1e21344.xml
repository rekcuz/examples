   <title>BRONN, HEINRICH GEORG</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRONN, HEINRICH GEORG--> (1800-1862), German geologist, was born
  on the 3rd of March 1800 at Ziegelhausen near Heidelberg. Studying at the
  university at Heidelberg he took his doctor's degree in the faculty of
  medicine in 1821, and in the following year was appointed professor of
  natural history. He now devoted himself to palaeontological studies, and
  to fieldwork in various parts of Germany, Italy and France. From its
  commencement in 1830 to 1862 he assisted in editing the <i>Jahrbuch für
  Mineralogie</i>, &amp;c., continued as <i>Neues Jahrbuch.</i> His
  principal work, <i>Lethaea Geognostica</i> (2 vols., Stuttgart,
  1834-1838; 3rd ed. with F. Römer, 3 vols., 1851-1856), has been regarded
  as one of the foundations of German stratigraphical geology. His
  <i>Handbuch einer Geschichte der Natur</i>, of which the first part was
  issued in 1841, gave a general account of the physical history of the
  earth, while the second part dealt with the life-history, species being
  regarded as direct acts of creation. The third part included his famous
  <i>Index Palaeontologicus</i>, and was issued in 3 vols., 1848-1849, with
  the assistance of H. von Meyer and H. R. Göppert. This record of fossils
  has proved of inestimable value to all palaeontologists. An important
  work on recent and fossil zoology, <i>Die Klassen und Ordnungen des
  Thier-Reichs</i>, was commenced by Bronn. He wrote the volumes dealing
  with Amorphozoa, Actinozoa, and Malacozoa, published 1859-1862; the work
  was continued by other naturalists. In 1861 Bronn was awarded the
  Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of London. He died at
  Heidelberg on the 5th of July 1862.</p>
