      <p><!--BRIGADE--> (Fr. and Ger. <i>brigade</i>, Ital. <i>brigata</i>,
  Span. <i>brigada</i>; the English use of the word dates from the early
  17th century), a unit in military organization commanded by a
  major-general, brigadier-general or colonel, and composed of two or more
  regiments of infantry, cavalry or artillery. The British infantry brigade
  consists as a rule of four battalions (or about 4000 bayonets) with
  supply, transport and medical units attached; the cavalry brigade of two
  or three regiments of cavalry. An artillery "brigade" (field, horse, and
  heavy) is in Great Britain a smaller unit, forming a lieut.-colonel's
  command and consisting of two or three batteries. (See <ph outputclass="sc">Army, Artillery, Infantry</ph>, and <ph outputclass="sc">Cavalry</ph>.) The staff of an infantry or cavalry brigade
  usually consists of the brigadier commanding, his aide-de-camp, and the
  brigade-major, a staff officer whose duties are intermediate between
  those of an adjutant and those of a general staff officer.</p>
