   <body>
      <p><!--BRÜCKMANN, FRANZ ERNST--> (1697-1753), German mineralogist, was
  born on the 27th of September 1697 at Marienthal near Helmstädt. Having
  qualified as a medical man in 1721, he practised at Brunswick and
  afterwards at Wolfenbüttel. His leisure time was given up to natural
  history, and especially to mineralogy and botany. He appears to have been
  the first to introduce the term <i>oolithus</i> to rocks that resemble in
  structure the roe of a fish; whence the terms oolite and oolitic. He died
  at Wolfenbüttel on the 21st of March 1753. He published <i>Magnalia Dei
  in locis subterraneis</i> (Brunswick, 1727), <i>Historia naturalis
  curiosa lapidis</i> (1727), and <i>Thesaurus subterraneus Ducatus
  Brunsvigii</i> (1728).</p>
