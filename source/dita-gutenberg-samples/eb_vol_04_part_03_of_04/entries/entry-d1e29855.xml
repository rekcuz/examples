   <title>BUCK, CARL DARLING</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCK, CARL DARLING--> (1866- ), American philologist, was born on
  the 2nd of October 1866, at Bucksport, Maine. He graduated at Yale in
  1886, was a graduate student there for three years, and studied at the
  American School of Classical Studies in Athens (1887-1889) and in Leipzig
  (1889-1892). In 1892 he became professor of Sanskrit and Indo-European
  comparative philology in the University of Chicago; but it is in the
  narrower field of the Italic dialects that his important work lies,
  including <i>Der Vocalismus der oskischen Sprache</i> (1892), <i>The
  Oscan-Umbrian Verb-System</i> (1895), and <i>Grammar of Oscan and
  Umbrian</i> (1904), as well as an excellent <i>pr√©cis</i> of the Italic
  languages in <i>Johnson's Universal Cyclopaedia</i>. He collaborated with
  W.G. Hale (<i>q.v.</i>) in the preparation of <i>A Latin Grammar</i>
  (1903). Of his contributions to reviews on phonological topics, perhaps
  the most important is his discussion of "Brugmann's Law."</p>
