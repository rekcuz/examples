      <p><!--BRIVE,--> or <ph outputclass="sc">Brives-la-Gaillarde</ph>, a town
  of south-central France, capital of an arrondissement in the department
  of Corrèze, 62 m. S.S.E. of Limoges on the main line of the Orléans
  railway from Paris to Montauban. Pop. (1906) town 14,954; commune 20,636.
  It lies on the left bank of the Corrèze in an ample and fertile plain,
  which is the meeting-place of important roads and railways. The
  <i>enceinte</i> which formerly surrounded the town has been replaced by
  shady boulevards, and a few wide thoroughfares have been made, but many
  narrow winding streets and ancient houses still remain. Outside the
  boulevards lie the modern quarters, also the fine promenade planted with
  plane trees which stretches to the Corrèze and contains the chief
  restaurants and the theatre. Here also is the statue of Marshal Guillaume
  Marie Anne Brune, who was a native of Brive. A fine bridge leads over the
  river to suburbs on its right bank. The public buildings are of little
  interest apart from the church of St Martin, which stands in the heart of
  the old town. It is a building of the 12th century in the Romanesque
  style of Limousin, with three narrow naves of almost equal height. The
  ecclesiastical seminary occupies a graceful mansion of the 16th century,
  with a façade, a staircase and fireplaces of fine Renaissance
  workmanship. Brive is the seat of a sub-prefect <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page619">[v.04 p.0619]</ph>and has a
  tribunal of first instance, a tribunal of commerce, a communal college
  and a school of industry. Its position makes it a market of importance,
  and it has a very large trade in the early vegetables and fruit of the
  valley of the Corrèze, and in grain, live-stock and truffles.
  Table-delicacies, paper, wooden shoes, hats, wax and earthenware are
  manufactured, and there are slate and millstone workings and
  dye-works.</p>
      <p>In the vicinity are numerous rock caves, many of them having been used
  as dwellings in prehistoric times. The best known are those of Lamouroux,
  excavated in stages in a vertical wall of rock, and four grotto-chapels
  resorted to by pilgrims in memory of St Anthony of Padua, who founded a
  Franciscan monastery at Brive in 1226. Under the Romans Brive was known
  as <i>Briva Curretiae</i> (bridge of the Corrèze). In the middle ages it
  was the capital of lower Limousin.</p>
