   <title>BREVIARY</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BREVIARY--> (Lat. <i>breviarium</i>, abridgment, epitome), the
  book which contains the offices for the canonical hours, <i>i.e.</i> the
  daily service of the Roman Catholic Church. As compared with the Anglican
  Book of Common Prayer it is both more and less comprehensive; more, in
  that it includes lessons and hymns for every day in the year; less,
  because it excludes the Eucharistic office (contained in the Missal), and
  the special offices connected with baptism, marriage, burial, ordination,
  &amp;c., which are found in the Ritual or the Pontifical. In the early
  days of Christian worship, when Jewish custom was followed, the Bible
  furnished all that was thought necessary, containing as it did the books
  from which the lessons were read and the psalms that were recited. The
  first step in the evolution of the Breviary was the separation of the
  Psalter into a choir-book. At first the president of the local church
  (bishop) or the leader of the choir chose a particular psalm as he
  thought appropriate. From about the 4th century certain psalms began to
  be grouped together, a process that was furthered by the monastic
  practice of daily reciting the 150 psalms. This took so much time that
  the monks began to spread it over a week, dividing each day into hours,
  and allotting to each hour its portion of the Psalter. St Benedict in the
  6th century drew up such an arrangement, probably, though not certainly,
  on the basis of an older Roman division which, though not so skilful, is
  the one in general use. Gradually there were added to these psalter
  choir-books additions in the form of antiphons, responses, collects or
  short prayers, for the use of those not skilful at improvisation and
  metrical compositions. Jean Beleth, a 12th-century liturgical author,
  gives the following list of books necessary for the right conduct of the
  canonical office:—the <i>Antiphonarium</i>, the Old and New
  Testaments, the <i>Passionarius</i> (<i>liber</i>) and the
  <i>Legendarius</i> (dealing respectively with martyrs and saints), the
  <i>Homiliarius</i> (homilies on the Gospels), the <i>Sermologus</i>
  (collection of sermons) and the works of the Fathers, besides, of course,
  the <i>Psalterium</i> and the <i>Collectarium</i>. To overcome the
  inconvenience of using such a library the Breviary came into existence
  and use. Already in the 8th century Prudentius, bishop of Troyes, had in
  a <i>Breviarium Psalterii</i> made an abridgment of the Psalter for the
  laity, giving a few psalms for each day, and Alcuin had rendered a
  similar service by including a prayer for each day and some other
  prayers, but no lessons or homilies. The Breviary rightly so called,
  however, only dates from the 11th century; the earliest MS. containing
  the whole canonical office is of the year 1099 and is in the Mazarin
  library. Gregory VII. (pope 1073-1085), too, simplified the liturgy as
  performed at the Roman court, and gave his abridgment the name of
  Breviary, which thus came to denote a work which from another point of
  view might be called a Plenary, involving as it did the collection of
  several works into one. There are several extant specimens of
  12th-century Breviaries, all Benedictine, but under Innocent III. (pope
  1198-1216) their use was extended, especially by the newly founded and
  active Franciscan order. These preaching friars, with the authorization
  of Gregory IX., adopted (with some modifications, <i>e.g.</i> the
  substitution of the "Gallican" for the "Roman" version of the Psalter)
  the Breviary hitherto used exclusively by the Roman court, and with it
  gradually swept out of Europe all the earlier partial books (Legendaries,
  Responsories), &amp;c., and to some extent the local Breviaries, like
  that of Sarum. Finally, Nicholas III. (pope 1277-1280) adopted this
  version both for the curia and for the basilicas of Rome, and thus made
  its position secure. The Benedictines and Dominicans have Breviaries of
  their own. The only other types that merit notice are:—(1) the
  Mozarabic Breviary, once in use throughout all Spain, but now confined to
  a single foundation at Toledo; it is remarkable for the number and length
  of its hymns, and for the fact that the majority of its collects are
  addressed to God the Son; (2) the Ambrosian, now confined to Milan, where
  it owes its retention to the attachment of the clergy and people to their
  traditionary rites, which they derive from St Ambrose (see <ph outputclass="sc">Liturgy</ph>).</p>
      <p>
         <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page504">[v.04 p.0504]</ph>
      </p>
      <p>Till the council of Trent every bishop had full power to regulate the
  Breviary of his own diocese; and this was acted upon almost everywhere.
  Each monastic community, also, had one of its own. Pius V. (pope
  1566-1572), however, while sanctioning those which could show at least
  200 years of existence, made the Roman obligatory in all other places.
  But the influence of the court of Rome has gradually gone much beyond
  this, and has superseded almost all the local "uses." The Roman has thus
  become nearly universal, with the allowance only of additional offices
  for saints specially venerated in each particular diocese. The Roman
  Breviary has undergone several revisions: The most remarkable of these is
  that by Francis Quignonez, cardinal of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (1536),
  which, though not accepted by Rome,<xref href="#d1e687/Footnote_031" type="fn"><!--[1]--></xref> formed the model for the still
  more thorough reform made in 1549 by the Church of England, whose daily
  morning and evening services are but a condensation and simplification of
  the Breviary offices. Some parts of the prefaces at the beginning of the
  English Prayer-Book are free translations of those of Quignonez. The Pian
  Breviary was again altered by Sixtus V. in 1588, who introduced the
  revised Vulgate text; by Clement VIII. in 1602 (through Baronius and
  Bellarmine), especially as concerns the rubrics; and by Urban VIII.
  (1623-1644), a purist who unfortunately tampered with the text of the
  hymns, injuring both their literary charm and their historic worth.</p>
      <p>In the 17th and 18th centuries a movement of revision took place in
  France, and succeeded in modifying about half the Breviaries of that
  country. Historically, this proceeded from the labours of Jean de Launoy
  (1603-1678), "le dénicheur des saints," and Louis Sébastien le Nain de
  Tillemont, who had shown the falsity of numerous lives of the saints;
  while theologically it was produced by the Port Royal school, which led
  men to dwell more on communion with God as contrasted with the invocation
  of the saints. This was mainly carried out by the adoption of a rule that
  all antiphons and responses should be in the exact words of Scripture,
  which, of course, cut out the whole class of appeals to created beings.
  The services were at the same time simplified and shortened, and the use
  of the whole Psalter every week (which had become a mere theory in the
  Roman Breviary, owing to its frequent supersession by saints' day
  services) was made a reality. These reformed French
  Breviaries—<i>e.g.</i> the Paris Breviary of 1680 by Archbishop
  François de Harlay (1625-1695) and that of 1736 by Archbishop Charles
  Gaspard Guillaume de Vintimille (1655-1746)—show a deep knowledge
  of Holy Scripture, and much careful adaptation of different texts; but
  during the pontificate of Pius IX. a strong Ultramontane movement arose
  against them. This was inaugurated by Montalembert, but its literary
  advocates were chiefly Dom Gueranger, a learned Benedictine monk, abbot
  of Solesmes, and Louis François Veuillot (1813-1883) of the
  <i>Univers</i>; and it succeeded in suppressing them everywhere, the last
  diocese to surrender being Orleans in 1875. The Jansenist and Gallican
  influence was also strongly felt in Italy and in Germany, where
  Breviaries based on the French models were published at Cologne, Münster,
  Mainz and other towns. Meanwhile, under the direction of Benedict XIV.
  (pope 1740-1758), a special congregation collected many materials for an
  official revision, but nothing was published. Subsequent changes have
  been very few and minute. In 1902, under Leo XIII., a commission under
  the presidency of Monsignor Louis Duchesne was appointed to consider the
  Breviary, the Missal, the Pontifical and the Ritual.</p>
      <p>The beauty and value of many of the Latin Breviaries were brought to
  the notice of English churchmen by one of the numbers of the Oxford
  <i>Tracts for the Times</i>, since which time they have been much more
  studied, both for their own sake and for the light they throw upon the
  English Prayer-Book.</p>
      <p>From a bibliographical point of view some of the early printed
  Breviaries are among the rarest of literary curiosities, being merely
  local. The copies were not spread far, and were soon worn out by the
  daily use made of them. Doubtless many editions have perished without
  leaving a trace of their existence, while others are known by unique
  copies. In Scotland the only one which has survived the convulsions of
  the 16th century is that of Aberdeen, a Scottish form of the Sarum
  Office,<xref href="#d1e687/Footnote_032" type="fn"><!--[2]--></xref>
  revised by William Elphinstone (bishop 1483-1514), and printed at
  Edinburgh by Walter Chapman and Andrew Myllar in 1509-1510. Four copies
  have been preserved of it, of which only one is complete; but it was
  reprinted in facsimile in 1854 for the Bannatyne Club by the munificence
  of the duke of Buccleuch. It is particularly valuable for the trustworthy
  notices of the early history of Scotland which are embedded in the lives
  of the national saints. Though enjoined by royal mandate in 1501 for
  general use within the realm of Scotland, it was probably never widely
  adopted. The new Scottish <i>Proprium</i> sanctioned for the Roman
  Catholic province of St Andrews in 1903 contains many of the old Aberdeen
  collects and antiphons.</p>
      <p>The Sarum or Salisbury Breviary itself was very widely used. The first
  edition was printed at Venice in 1483 by Raynald de Novimagio in folio;
  the latest at Paris, 1556, 1557. While modern Breviaries are nearly
  always printed in four volumes, one for each season of the year, the
  editions of the Sarum never exceeded two parts.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Contents of the Roman Breviary</i>.—At the beginning stands
  the usual introductory matter, such as the tables for determining the
  date of Easter, the calendar, and the general rubrics. The Breviary
  itself is divided into four seasonal parts—winter, spring, summer,
  autumn—and comprises under each part (1) the Psalter; (2)
  <i>Proprium de Tempore</i> (the special office of the season); (3)
  <i>Proprium Sanctorum</i> (special offices of saints); (4) <i>Commune
  Sanctorum</i> (general offices for saints); (5) Extra Services. These
  parts are often published separately.</p>
      <p>1. <i>The Psalter</i>.—This is the very backbone of the
  Breviary, the groundwork of the Catholic prayer-book; out of it have
  grown the antiphons, responsories and versicles. In the Breviary the
  psalms are arranged according to a disposition dating from the 8th
  century, as follows. Psalms i.-cviii., with some omissions, are recited
  at Matins, twelve each day from Monday to Saturday, and eighteen on
  Sunday. The omissions are said at Lauds, Prime and Compline. Psalms
  cix.-cxlvii. (except cxvii., cxviii. and cxlii.) are said at Vespers,
  five each day. Psalms cxlviii.-cl. are always used at Lauds, and give
  that hour its name. The text of this Psalter is that commonly known as
  the Gallican. The name is misleading, for it is simply the second
  revision (<ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph> 392) made by Jerome of the old
  <i>Itala</i> version originally used in Rome. Jerome's first revision of
  the <i>Itala</i> (<ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph> 383), known as the
  Roman, is still used at St Peter's in Rome, but the "Gallican," thanks
  especially to St Gregory of Tours, who introduced it into Gaul in the 6th
  century, has ousted it everywhere else. The Antiphonary of Bangor proves
  that Ireland accepted the Gallican version in the 7th century, and the
  English Church did so in the 10th.</p>
      <p>2. The <i>Proprium de Tempore</i> contains the office of the seasons
  of the Christian year (Advent to Trinity), a conception that only
  gradually grew up. There is here given the whole service for every Sunday
  and week-day, the proper antiphons, responsories, hymns, and especially
  the course of daily Scripture-reading, averaging about twenty verses a
  day, and (roughly) arranged thus: for Advent, Isaiah; Epiphany to
  Septuagesima, Pauline Epistles; Lent, patristic homilies (Genesis on
  Sundays); Passion-tide, Jeremiah; Easter to Whitsun, Acts, Catholic
  epistles and Apocalypse; Whitsun to August, Samuel and Kings; August to
  Advent, Wisdom books, Maccabees, Prophets. The extracts are often scrappy
  and torn out of their context.</p>
      <p>3. The <i>Proprium Sanctorum</i> contains the lessons, psalms and
  liturgical formularies for saints' festivals, and depends on the days of
  the secular month. Most of the material here is hagiological biography,
  occasionally revised as by Leo XIII. in view of archaeological and other
  discoveries, but still largely uncritical. Covering a great stretch of
  time and space, they do for the worshipper in the field of church history
  what the Scripture readings do in that of biblical history. As something
  like 90% of the days in the year have, during the course of centuries,
  been allotted to some saint or other, it is easy to see how this section
  of the Breviary has encroached upon the <i>Proprium de Tempore</i>, and
  this is the chief problem that confronts any who are concerned for a
  revision of the Breviary.</p>
      <p>4. The <i>Commune Sanctorum</i> comprises psalms, antiphons, lessons,
  &amp;c., for feasts of various groups or classes (twelve in all);
  <i>e.g.</i> apostles, martyrs, confessors, virgins, and the Blessed
  Virgin Mary. These offices are of very ancient date, and many of them
  were probably <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page505">[v.04 p.0505]</ph>in origin proper to individual
  saints. They contain passages of great literary beauty. The lessons read
  at the third nocturn are patristic homilies on the Gospels, and together
  form a rough summary of theological instruction.</p>
      <p>5. <i>Extra Services</i>.—Here are found the Little Office of
  the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Office of the Dead (obligatory on All Souls'
  Day), and offices peculiar to each diocese.</p>
      <p>It has already been indicated, by reference to Matins, Lauds, &amp;c.,
  that not only each day, but each part of the day, has its own office, the
  day being divided into liturgical "hours." A detailed account of these
  will be found in the article <ph outputclass="sc">Hours, Canonical</ph>.
  Each of the hours of the office is composed of the same elements, and
  something must be said now of the nature of these constituent parts, of
  which mention has here and there been already made. They are: psalms
  (including canticles), antiphons, responsories, hymns, lessons, little
  chapters, versicles and collects.</p>
      <p>The <i>psalms</i> have already been dealt with, but it may be noted
  again how the multiplication of saints' festivals, with practically the
  same special psalms, tends in practice to constant repetition of about
  one-third of the Psalter, and correspondingly rare recital of the
  remaining two-thirds, whereas the <i>Proprium de Tempore</i>, could it be
  adhered to, would provide equal opportunities for every psalm. As in the
  Greek usage and in the Benedictine, certain canticles like the Song of
  Moses (Exodus xv.), the Song of Hannah (1 Sam. ii.), the prayer of
  Habakkuk (iii.), the prayer of Hezekiah (Isaiah xxxviii.) and other
  similar Old Testament passages, and, from the New Testament, the
  Magnificat, the Benedictus and the Nunc dimittis, are admitted as
  psalms.</p>
      <p>The <i>antiphons</i> are short liturgical forms, sometimes of
  biblical, sometimes of patristic origin, used to introduce a psalm. The
  term originally signified a chant by alternate choirs, but has quite lost
  this meaning in the Breviary.</p>
      <p>The <i>responsories</i> are similar in form to the antiphons, but come
  at the end of the psalm, being originally the reply of the choir or
  congregation to the precentor who recited the psalm.</p>
      <p>The <i>hymns</i> are short poems going back in part to the days of
  Prudentius, Synesius, Gregory of Nazianzus and Ambrose (4th and 5th
  centuries), but mainly the work of medieval authors. Together they make a
  fine collection, and it is a pity that Urban VIII. in his mistaken
  humanistic zeal tried to improve them.</p>
      <p>The <i>lessons</i>, as has been seen, are drawn variously from the
  Bible, the Acts of the Saints and the Fathers of the Church. In the
  primitive church, books afterwards excluded from the canon were often
  read, <i>e.g.</i> the letters of Clement of Rome and the <i>Shepherd of
  Hermas</i>. In later days the churches of Africa, having rich memorials
  of martyrdom, used them to supplement the reading of Scripture. Monastic
  influence accounts for the practice of adding to the reading of a
  biblical passage some patristic commentary or exposition. Books of
  homilies were compiled from the writings of SS. Augustine, Hilary,
  Athanasius, Isidore, Gregory the Great and others, and formed part of the
  library of which the Breviary was the ultimate compendium. In the
  lessons, as in the psalms, the order for special days breaks in upon the
  normal order of ferial offices and dislocates the scheme for consecutive
  reading. The lessons are read at Matins (which is subdivided into three
  nocturns).</p>
      <p>The <i>little chapters</i> are very short lessons read at the other
  "hours."</p>
      <p>The <i>versicles</i> are short responsories used after the little
  chapters.</p>
      <p>The <i>collects</i> come at the close of the office and are short
  prayers summing up the supplications of the congregation. They arise out
  of a primitive practice on the part of the bishop (local president),
  examples of which are found in the <i>Didachē</i> (Teaching of the
  Apostles) and in the letters of Clement of Rome and Cyprian. With the
  crystallization of church order improvisation in prayer largely gave
  place to set forms, and collections of prayers were made which later
  developed into Sacramentaries and Orationals. The collects of the
  Breviary are largely drawn from the Gelasian and other Sacramentaries,
  and they are used to sum up the dominant idea of the festival in
  connexion with which they happen to be used.</p>
      <p>The difficulty of harmonizing the <i>Proprium de Tempore</i> and the
  <i>Proprium Sanctorum</i>, to which reference has been made, is only
  partly met in the thirty-seven chapters of general rubrics. Additional
  help is given by a kind of Catholic Churchman's Almanack, called the
  <i>Ordo Recitandi Divini Officii</i>, published in different countries
  and dioceses, and giving, under every day, minute directions for proper
  reading.</p>
      <p>Every clerk in orders and every member of a religious order must
  publicly join in or privately read aloud (<i>i.e.</i> using the lips as
  well as the eyes—it takes about two hours in this way) the whole of
  the Breviary services allotted for each day. In large churches the
  services are usually grouped; <i>e.g.</i> Matins and Lauds (about 7.30
  <ph outputclass="scac">A.M.</ph>); Prime, Terce (High Mass), Sext, and None
  (about 10 <ph outputclass="scac">A.M.</ph>); Vespers and Compline (4 <ph outputclass="scac">P.M.</ph>); and from four to eight hours (depending on the
  amount of music and the number of high masses) are thus spent in choir.
  Laymen do not use the Breviary as a manual of devotion to any great
  extent.</p>
      <p>The Roman Breviary has been translated into English (by the marquess
  of Bute in 1879; new ed. with a trans, of the Martyrology, 1908), French
  and German. The English version is noteworthy for its inclusion of the
  skilful renderings of the ancient hymns by J.H. Newman, J.M. Neale and
  others.</p>
