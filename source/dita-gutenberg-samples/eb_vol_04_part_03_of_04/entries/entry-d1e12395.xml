   <title>BRIGHT'S DISEASE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIGHT'S DISEASE,--> a term in medicine applied to a class of
  diseases of the kidneys (acute and chronic nephritis) which have as their
  most prominent symptom the presence of albumen in the urine, and
  frequently also the coexistence of dropsy. <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page571">[v.04 p.0571]</ph>These
  associated symptoms in connexion with kidney disease were first described
  in 1827 by Dr Richard Bright (1789-1858). Since that period it has been
  established that the symptoms, instead of being, as was formerly
  supposed, the result of one form of disease of the kidneys, may be
  dependent on various morbid conditions of those organs (see <ph outputclass="sc">Kidney Diseases</ph>). Hence the term Bright's disease,
  which is retained in medical nomenclature in honour of Dr Bright, must be
  understood as having a generic application.</p>
      <p>The symptoms are usually of a severe character. Pain in the back,
  vomiting and febrile disturbance commonly usher in the attack. Dropsy,
  varying in degree from slight puffiness of the face to an accumulation of
  fluid sufficient to distend the whole body, and to occasion serious
  embarrassment to respiration, is a very common accompaniment. The urine
  is reduced in quantity, is of dark, smoky or bloody colour, and exhibits
  to chemical reaction the presence of a large amount of albumen, while,
  under the microscope, blood corpuscles and casts, as above mentioned, are
  found in abundance.</p>
      <p>This state of acute inflammation may by its severity destroy life, or,
  short of this, may by continuance result in the establishment of one of
  the chronic forms of Bright's disease. On the other hand an arrest of the
  inflammatory action frequently occurs, and this is marked by the
  increased amount of the urine, and the gradual disappearance of its
  albumen and other abnormal constituents; as also by the subsidence of the
  dropsy and the rapid recovery of strength.</p>
      <p>In the treatment of acute Bright's disease, good results are often
  obtained from local depletion, from warm baths and from the careful
  employment of diuretics and purgatives. Chronic Bright's disease is much
  less amenable to treatment, but by efforts to maintain the strength and
  improve the quality of the blood by strong nourishment, and at the same
  time by guarding against the risks of complications, life may often be
  prolonged in comparative comfort, and even a certain measure of
  improvement be experienced.</p>
