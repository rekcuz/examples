   <title>BREVIARY OF ALARIC</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BREVIARY OF ALARIC--> (<i>Breviarium Alaricanum</i>), a collection
  of Roman law, compiled by order of Alaric II., king of the Visigoths,
  with the advice of his bishops and nobles, in the twenty-second year of
  his reign (<ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph> 506). It comprises sixteen
  books of the Theodosian code; the Novels of Theodosius II., Valentinian
  III., Marcian, Majorianus and Severus; the Institutes of Gaius; five
  books of the <i>Sententiae Receptae</i> of Julius Paulus; thirteen titles
  of the Gregorian code; two titles of the Hermogenian code; and a fragment
  of the first book of the <i>Responsa Papiniani</i>. It is termed a code
  (codex), in the certificate of Anianus, the king's referendary, but
  unlike the code of Justinian, from which the writings of jurists were
  excluded, it comprises both imperial constitutions (<i>leges</i>) and
  juridical treatises (<i>jura</i>). From the circumstance that the
  Breviarium has prefixed to it a royal rescript (<i>commonitorium</i>)
  directing that copies of it, certified under the hand of Anianus, should
  be received exclusively as law throughout the kingdom of the Visigoths,
  the compilation of the code has been attributed to Anianus by many
  writers, and it is frequently designated the Breviary of Anianus
  (Breviarium Aniani). The code, however, appears to have been known
  amongst the Visigoths by the title of "Lex Romana," or "Lex Theodosii,"
  and it was not until the 16th century that the title of "Breviarium" was
  introduced to distinguish it from a recast of the code, which was
  introduced into northern Italy in the 9th century for the use of the
  Romans in Lombardy. This recast of the Visigothic code has been preserved
  in a MS. known as the Codex Utinensis, which was formerly kept in the
  archives of the cathedral of Udine, but is now lost; and it was published
  in the 18th century for the first time by P. Canciani in his collection
  of ancient laws entitled <i>Barbarorum Leges Antiquae</i>. Another MS. of
  this Lombard recast of the Visigothic code was discovered by Hänel in the
  library of St Gall. The chief value of the Visigothic code consists in
  the fact that it is the only collection of Roman Law in which the five
  first books of the Theodosian code and five books of the <i>Sententiae
  Receptae</i> of Julius Paulus have been preserved, and until the
  discovery of a MS. in the chapter library in Verona, which contained the
  greater part of the Institutes of Gaius, it was the only work in which
  any portion of the institutional writings of that great jurist had come
  down to us.</p>
      <p>The most complete edition of the Breviarium will be found in the
  collection of Roman law published under the title of <i>Jus Civile
  Ante-Justinianum</i> (Berlin, 1815). See also G. Hänel's <i>Lex Romana
  Visigothorum</i> (Berlin, 1847-1849).</p>
