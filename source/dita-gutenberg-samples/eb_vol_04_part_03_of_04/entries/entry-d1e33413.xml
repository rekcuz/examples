   <title>BUGGE, SOPHUS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUGGE, SOPHUS--> (1833-1907), Norwegian philologist, was born at
  Laurvik, Norway, on the 5th of January 1833. He was educated at
  Christiania, Copenhagen and Berlin, and in 1866 he became professor of
  comparative philology and Old Norse at Christiania University. In
  addition to collecting Norwegian folk-songs and traditions, and writing
  on Runic inscriptions, he made considerable contributions to the study of
  the Celtic, Romance, Oscan, Umbrian and Etruscan languages. He was the
  author of a very large number of books on philology and folklore. His
  principal work, a critical edition of the elder Edda (<i>Norroen
  Fornkvoedi</i>), was published at Christiania in 1867. He maintained that
  the songs of the <i>Edda</i> and the earlier sagas were largely founded
  on Christian and Latin tradition imported into Scandinavian literature by
  way of England. His writings also include <i>Gamle Norske Folkeviser</i>
  (1858), a collection of Old Norse folk-songs; <i>Bidrag til den aeldste
  skaldedigtnings historie</i> (Christiania, 1894); <i>Helge-digtene i den
  Aeldre Edda</i> (Copenhagen, 1896, Eng. trans., <i>The Home of the Eddic
  Poems</i>, 1899); <i>Norsk Sagafortaelling op Sagaskrivning i Island</i>
  (Christiania, 1901), and various books on Runic inscriptions. He died on
  the 8th of July 1907.</p>

  Forfatter-Lexikon</i>, vol. i. (Christiania, 1885).</p>
