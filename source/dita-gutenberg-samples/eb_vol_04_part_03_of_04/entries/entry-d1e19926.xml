   <title>BROCHANTITE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROCHANTITE,--> a mineral species consisting of a basic copper
  sulphate Cu<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, crystallizing in
  the orthorhombic system. The crystals are usually small and are prismatic
  or acicular in habit; they have a perfect cleavage parallel to the face
  lettered a in the adjoining figure. They are transparent to translucent,
  with a vitreous lustre, and are of an emerald-green to blackish-green
  colour. Specific gravity 3.907; hardness 3½-4. The mineral was first
  found associated with malachite and native copper in the copper mines of
  the Urals, and was named by A. Lévy in 1824 after A.J.M. Brochant de
  Villiers. Several varieties, differing somewhat in crystalline form, have
  been distinguished, some of them having originally been described as
  distinct species, but afterwards proved to be essentially identical with
  brochantite; these are königine from the Urals, brongniartine from
  Mexico, krisuvigite from Iceland, and warringtonite from Cornwall. Of
  other localities, mention may be made of Roughten Gill, Caldbeck Fells,
  Cumberland, where small brilliant crystals are associated with malachite
  and chrysocolla in a quartzose rock; Rézbánya in the Bihar Mountains,
  Hungary; Atacama in Chile, with atacamite, which closely resembles
  brochantite in general appearance; the Tintic district in Utah. A
  microscopical examination of the green copper ores of secondary origin in
  the Clifton and Morenci district of Arizona proves brochantite to be of
  extremely common occurrence mostly intergrown with malachite which
  effectually masks its presence: it is not unlikely that the malachite of
  other localities will on examination be found to be intergrown with
  brochantite.</p>
      <p>Mention may be here made of another orthorhombic basic copper sulphate
  not unlike brochantite in general characters, but differing from it in
  containing water of crystallization and in its fine blue colour; this is
  the Cornish mineral langite, which has the composition
  CuSO<sub>4</sub>·3Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
