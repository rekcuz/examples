      <p><!--BUFFON, GEORGE LOUIS LECLERC,--> <ph outputclass="sc">Comte de</ph>
  (1707-1788), French naturalist, was born on the 7th of September 1707, at
  Montbard (Côte d'Or), his father, Benjamin François Leclerc de Buffon
  (1683-1775), being councillor of the Burgundian parlement. He studied law
  at the college of Jesuits at Dijon; but he soon exhibited a marked
  predilection for the study of the physical sciences, and more
  particularly for mathematics. Whilst at Dijon he made the acquaintance of
  a young Englishman, Lord Kingston, and with him travelled through Italy
  and then went to England. He published a French translation of Stephen
  Hales's <i>Vegetable Statics</i> in 1735, and of Sir I. Newton's
  <i>Fluxions</i> in 1740. At twenty-five years of age he succeeded to a
  considerable property, inherited from his mother, and from this time
  onward his life was devoted to regular scientific labour. At first he
  directed his attention more especially to mathematics, physics, <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page758">[v.04
  p.0758]</ph>and agriculture, and his chief original papers are
  connected with these subjects. In the spring of 1739 he was elected an
  associate of the Academy of Sciences; and at a later period of the same
  year he was appointed keeper of the Jardin du Roi and of the Royal
  Museum. This appears to have finally determined him to devote himself to
  the biological sciences in particular, and he began to collect materials
  for his <i>Natural History</i>. In the preparation of this voluminous
  work he associated with himself L.J.M. Daubenton, to whom the descriptive
  and anatomical portions of the treaties were entrusted, and the first
  three volumes made their appearance in the year 1749. In 1752 (not in
  1743 or 1760, as sometimes stated) he married Marie Françoise de
  Saint-Belin. He seems to have been fondly attached to her, and felt
  deeply her death at Montbard in 1769. The remainder of Buffon's life as a
  private individual presents nothing of special interest. He belonged to a
  very long-lived race, his father having attained the age of ninety-three,
  and his grandfather eighty-seven. He himself died at Paris on the 15th of
  April 1788, at the age of eighty-one, of vesical calculus, having refused
  to allow any operation for his relief. He left one son, George Louis
  Marie Leclerc Buffon, who was an officer in the French army, and who died
  by the guillotine, at the age of thirty, on the 10th of July 1793 (22
  Messidor, An II.), having espoused the party of the duke of Orleans.</p>
      <p>Buffon was a member of the French Academy (his inaugural address being
  the celebrated <i>Discours sur le style</i>, 1753), perpetual treasurer
  of the Academy of Sciences, fellow of the Royal Society of London, and
  member of the Academies of Berlin, St Petersburg, Dijon, and of most of
  the learned societies then existing in Europe. Of handsome person and
  noble presence, endowed with many of the external gifts of nature, and
  rejoicing in the social advantages of high rank and large possessions, he
  is mainly known by his published scientific writings. Without being a
  profound original investigator, he possessed the art of expressing his
  ideas in a clear and generally attractive form. His chief defects as a
  scientific writer are that he was given to excessive and hasty
  generalization, so that his hypotheses, however seemingly brilliant, are
  often destitute of any sufficient basis in observed facts, whilst his
  literary style is not unfrequently theatrical and turgid, and a great
  want of method and order is commonly observable in his writings.</p>
      <p>His great work is the <i>Histoire naturelle, générale et
  particulière</i>; and it can undoubtedly claim the merit of having been
  the first work to present the previously isolated and apparently
  disconnected facts of natural history in a popular and generally
  intelligible form. The sensation which was made by its appearance in
  successive parts was very great, and it certainly effected much good in
  its time by generally diffusing a taste for the study of nature. For a
  work so vast, however—aiming, as it did, at being little less than
  a general encyclopaedia of the sciences—Buffon's capacities may,
  without disparagement, be said to have been insufficient, as is shown by
  the great weakness of parts of the work (such as those relating to
  mineralogy). The <i>Histoire naturelle</i> passed through several
  editions, and was translated into various languages. The edition most
  highly prized by collectors, on account of the beauty of its plates, is
  the first, which was published in Paris (1749-1804) in forty-four quarto
  volumes, the publication extending over more than fifty years. In the
  preparation of the first fifteen volumes of this edition (1749-1767)
  Buffon was assisted by Daubenton, and subsequently by P. Guéneau de
  Montbéliard, the abbé G.L.C.A. Bexon, and C.N.S. Sonnini de Manoncourt.
  The following seven volumes form a supplement to the preceding, and
  appeared in 1774-1789, the famous <i>Époques de la nature</i> (1779)
  being the fifth of them. They were succeeded by nine volumes on the birds
  (1770-1783), and these again by five volumes on minerals (1783-1788). The
  remaining eight volumes, which complete this edition, appeared after
  Buffon's death, and comprise reptiles, fishes and cetaceans. They were
  executed by B.G.E. de Lacépède, and were published in successive volumes
  between 1788 and 1804. A second edition begun in 1774 and completed in
  1804, in thirty-six volumes quarto, is in most respects similar to the
  first, except that the anatomical descriptions are suppressed and the
  supplement recast.</p>
