      <p><!--BRIZO,--> an ancient goddess worshipped in Delos. She delivered
  oracles in dreams to those who consulted her about fishery and seafaring.
  The women of Delos offered her presents consisting of little boats filled
  with all kinds of eatables (with the exception of <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page620">[v.04 p.0620]</ph>fish) in order
  to obtain her protection for those engaged on the sea (Athenaeus viii. p.
  335).</p>
