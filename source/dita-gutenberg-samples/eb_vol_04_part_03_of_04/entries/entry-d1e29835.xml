   <title>BUCHU</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCHU,--> or <ph outputclass="sc">Buka Leaves</ph>, the produce of
  several shrubby plants belonging to the genus Barosma (nat. order
  Rutaceae), natives of the Cape of Good Hope. The principal species, <i>B.
  crenulata</i>, has leaves of a smooth leathery texture, oblong-ovate in
  shape, from an inch to an inch and a half in length, with serrulate or
  crenulate margins, on which as well as on the under side are conspicuous
  oil-glands. The other species which yield buchu are <i>B.
  serratifolia</i>, having linear-lanceolate sharply serrulate leaves, and
  <i>B. betulina</i>, the leaves of which are cuneate-obovate, with
  denticulate margins. They are all, as found in commerce, of a pale
  yellow-green colour; they emit a peculiar aromatic odour, and have a
  slightly astringent bitter taste. Buchu leaves contain a volatile oil,
  which is of a dark yellow colour, and deposits a form of camphor on
  exposure to air, a liquid hydro-carbon being the solvent of the camphor
  within the oil-glands. There is also present a minute quantity of a
  bitter principle. The leaves of a closely allied plant, <i>Empleurum
  serratulum</i>, are employed as a substitute or adulterant for buchu. As
  these possess no glands they are a worthless substitute. The British
  Pharmacopoeia contains an infusion and tincture of buchu. The former may
  be given in doses of an ounce and the latter in doses of a drachm. The
  drug has the properties common to all substances that contain a volatile
  oil. The infusion contains very little of the oil and is of very slight
  value. Until the advent of the modern synthetic products buchu was valued
  in diseases of the urinary tract, but its use is now practically
  obsolete.</p>
