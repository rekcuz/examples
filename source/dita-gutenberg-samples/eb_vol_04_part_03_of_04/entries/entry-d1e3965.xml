      <p><!--BRIDAINE--> (or <ph outputclass="sc">Brydayne</ph>), <b>JACQUES</b>
  (1701-1767), French Roman Catholic preacher, was born at Chuslan in the
  department of Gard on the 21st of March 1701. He was educated at Avignon,
  first in the Jesuit college and afterwards at the Sulpician seminary of
  St Charles. Soon after his ordination to the priesthood in 1725, he
  joined the <i>Missions Royales</i>, organized to bring back to the
  Catholíc faith the Protestants of France. He gained their good-will and
  made many converts; and for over forty years he visited as a missionary
  preacher almost every town of central and southern France. In Paris, in
  1744, his sermons created a deep impression by their eloquence and
  sincerity. He died at Roquemaure, near Avignon, on the 22nd of December
  1767. He was the author of <i>Cantiques spirituels</i> (Montpelier, 1748,
  frequently reprinted, in use in most French churches); his sermons were
  published in 5 vols. at Avignon in 1823 (ed. Paris, 1861).</p>
