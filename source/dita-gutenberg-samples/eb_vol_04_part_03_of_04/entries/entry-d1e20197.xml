      <p><!--BROEKHUIZEN, JAN VAN--> [<ph outputclass="sc">Janus
  Broukhusius</ph>], (1649-1707), Dutch classical scholar and poet, was
  born on the 20th of November 1649, at Amsterdam. Having lost his father
  when very young, he was placed with an apothecary, with whom he lived
  several years. Not liking this employment, he entered the army, and in
  1674 was sent with his regiment to America, in the fleet under Admiral de
  Ruyter, but returned to Holland the same year. In 1678 he was sent to the
  garrison at Utrecht, where he contracted a friendship with the celebrated
  Graevius; here he had the misfortune to be so deeply implicated in a duel
  that, according to the laws of Holland, his life was forfeited. Graevius,
  however, wrote immediately to Nicholas Heinsius, who obtained his pardon.
  Not long afterwards he became a captain of one of the companies then at
  Amsterdam. After the peace of Ryswick, 1697, his company was disbanded,
  and he retired on a pension to a country house near Amsterdam and pursued
  his classical and literary studies at leisure. His Dutch poems, in which
  he followed the model of Pieter Hooft, were first published in 1677; a
  later edition, with a biography by D. van Hoogstraten, appeared in 1712,
  the last edition, 1883, was edited by R.A. Kollewijn. His classical
  reputation rests on his editions of Propertius (1702) and Tibullus
  (1707). His Latin poems (<i>Carmina</i>) appeared in 1684; a later
  edition(<i>Poemata</i>) by D. van Hoogstraten appeared in 1711. The
  <i>Select Letters</i> (<i>Jani Browkhusii Epistolae Selectae</i>, 1889
  and 1893) were edited by J.A. Worp, who also wrote his biography, 1891.
  Broekhuizen died on the 15th of December 1707.</p>
