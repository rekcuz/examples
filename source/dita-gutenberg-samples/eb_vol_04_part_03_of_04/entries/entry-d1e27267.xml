   <body>
      <p><!--BRYNMAWR,--> a market town of Brecknockshire, Wales, 14Â½ m. S.E.
  of Brecknock and 156 m. from London by rail. Pop. of urban district
  (1901) 6833. It is on the London &amp; North-Western and Rhymney joint
  railway connecting Rhymney and Abergavenny, being also a junction for a
  branch line to Pontypool via Blaenavon, and the terminus of the Great
  Western line from Newport via Nantyglo. The town owes its origin to the
  development during the first half of the 19th century of ironworks at the
  upper ends of the valleys that converge in its neighbourhood, its site
  being previously known as Waun Helygen (Willow-tree Common). The Nantyglo
  ironworks afford occupation to large numbers of the inhabitants of
  Brynmawr. Both coal and iron ore were formerly worked, but the coal is
  exhausted and the ore unsuitable for modern processes. Brynmawr was
  formed into an ecclesiastical parish in 1875 out of portions of the civil
  parishes of Llanelly and Llangattock. In 1894 this was formed into an
  urban district, which was enlarged in 1900 by the addition of a portion
  of the parish of Aberystruth in Monmouthshire, the whole being at the
  same time consolidated into a civil parish.</p>
