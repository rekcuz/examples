   <title>BROCK, SIR ISAAC</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROCK, SIR ISAAC--> (1769-1812), British soldier and
  administrator, was born at St Peter Port, Guernsey, on the 6th of October
  1769. Joining the army at the age of fifteen as an ensign of the 8th
  regiment, he became a lieutenant-colonel in 1797, after less than
  thirteen years' service. He commanded the 49th regiment in the expedition
  to North Holland in 1799, was wounded at the battle of Egmont-op-Zee, and
  subsequently served on board the British fleet at the battle of
  Copenhagen. From 1802 to 1805 he was with his regiment in Canada,
  returning thither in 1806 in view of the imminence of war between Great
  Britain and the United States. From September 1806 till August 1810 he
  was in charge of the garrison at Quebec; in the latter year he assumed
  the command of the troops in Upper Canada, and soon afterwards took over
  the civil administration of that province as provisional
  lieutenant-governor. On the outbreak of the war of 1812 Brock had to
  defend Upper Canada against invasion by the United States. In the face of
  many difficulties and not a little disaffection, he organized the militia
  of the province, drove back the invaders, and on the 16th of August 1812,
  with about 730 men and 600 Indians commanded by their chief Tecumseh,
  compelled the American force of 2500 men under General William Hull
  (1753-1825) to surrender at Detroit, an achievement which gained him a
  knighthood of the Bath and the popular title of "the hero of Upper
  Canada" From Detroit he hurried to the Niagara frontier, but on the 13th
  of October in the same year was killed at the battle of Queenston
  Heights. The House of Commons voted a public monument to his memory,
  which was erected in Saint Paul's cathedral, London. On the 13th of
  October 1824, the twelfth anniversary of his death, his remains were
  removed from the bastions of Fort George, where they had been originally
  interred, and placed beneath a monument on Queenston Heights, erected by
  the provincial legislature. This was blown up by a fanatic in 1840, but
  as the result of a mass-meeting of over 8000 citizens held on the spot, a
  new and more stately monument was erected.</p>
      <p>His <i>Life and Correspondence</i> by his nephew, Ferdinand Brock
  Tupper (2nd edition, London, 1847), still remains the best; later lives
  are by D.R. Read (Toronto, 1894), and by Lady Edgar (Toronto and
  London,1905).</p>
