      <p><!--BRIDGET, SAINT,--> more properly <ph outputclass="sc">Brigid</ph>
  (c. 452-523), one of the patron saints of Ireland, was born at Faughart
  in county Louth, her father being a prince of Ulster. Refusing to marry,
  she chose a life of seclusion, making her cell, the first in Ireland,
  under a large oak tree, whence the place was called Kil-dara, "the church
  of the oak." The city of Kildare is supposed to derive its name from St
  Brigid's cell. The year of her death is generally placed in 523. She was
  buried at Kildare, but her remains were afterwards translated to
  Downpatrick, where they were laid beside the bodies of St Patrick and St
  Columba. Her feast is celebrated on the 1st of February. A large
  collection of miraculous stories clustered round her name, and her
  reputation was not confined to Ireland, for, under the name of St Bride,
  she became a favourite saint in England, and numerous churches were
  dedicated to her in Scotland.</p>
