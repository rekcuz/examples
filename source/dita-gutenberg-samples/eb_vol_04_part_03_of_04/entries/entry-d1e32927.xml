   <title>BUELL, DON CARLOS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUELL, DON CARLOS--> (1818-1898), American soldier, was born near
  Marietta, Ohio, on the 23rd of March 1818. He graduated at West Point in
  1841, and as a company officer of infantry took part in the Seminole War
  of 1841-42 and the Mexican War, during which he was present at almost all
  the battles fought by Generals Taylor and Scott, winning the brevet of
  captain at Monterey, and that of major at Contreras-Churubusco, where he
  was wounded. From 1848 to 1861 he performed various staff duties, chiefly
  as assistant-adjutant-general. On the outbreak of the Civil War he was
  appointed lieutenant-colonel on the 11th of May 1861, brigadier-general
  of volunteers a few days later, and major-general of volunteers in March
  1862. He aided efficiently in organizing the Army of the Potomac, and, at
  the instance of General McClellan, was sent, in November 1861, to
  Kentucky to succeed General William T. Sherman in command. Here he
  employed himself in the organization and training of the Army of the Ohio
  (subsequently of the Cumberland), which to the end of its career retained
  a standard of discipline and efficiency only surpassed by that of the
  Army of the Potomac. In the spring of 1862 Buell followed the retiring
  Confederates under Sidney Johnston, and appeared on the field of Shiloh
  (<i>q.v.</i>) at the end of the first day's fighting. On the following
  day, aided by Buell's fresh and well-trained army, Grant carried all
  before him. Buell subsequently served under Halleck in the advance on
  Corinth, and in the autumn commanded in the campaign in Kentucky against
  Bragg. After a period of man≈ìuvring in which Buell scarcely held
  his own, this virtually ended in the indecisive battle of Perryville. The
  alleged tardiness of his pursuit, and his objection to a plan of campaign
  ordered by the Washington authorities, brought about Buell's removal from
  command. With all his gifts as an organizer and disciplinarian, he was
  haughty in his dealings with the civil authorities, and, in high command,
  he showed, on the whole, unnecessary tardiness of movement and an utter
  disregard for the requirements of the political situation. Moreover, as
  McClellan's friend, holding similar views, adverse politically to the
  administration, he suffered by McClellan's displacement. The complaints
  made against him were investigated in 1862-1863, but the result of the
  investigation was not published. Subsequently he was offered military
  employment, which he declined. He resigned his volunteer commission in
  May, and his regular commission in June 1864. He was president of Green
  River ironworks (1865-1870), and subsequently engaged in various mining
  enterprises; he served (1885-1889) as pension agent at Louisville. He
  died near Rockport, Kentucky, on the 19th of November 1898.</p>
