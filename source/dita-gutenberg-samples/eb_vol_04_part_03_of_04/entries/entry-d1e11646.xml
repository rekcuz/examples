   <title>BRIDLINGTON</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIDLINGTON,--> a market town, municipal borough and seaside
  resort in the Buckrose parliamentary division of the East Riding of
  Yorkshire, England, 31 m. N.N.E. from Hull by a branch of the North
  Eastern railway. Pop. (1891) 8919; (1901) 12,482. It is divided into two
  parts, the ancient market town lying about 1 m. from the coast, while the
  modern houses of Bridlington Quay, the watering-place, fringe the shore
  of Bridlington Bay. Southward the coast becomes low, but northward it is
  steep and very fine, where the great spur of Flamborough Head
  (<i>q.v.</i>) projects eastward. In the old town of Bridlington the
  church of St Mary and St Nicholas consists of the fine Decorated and
  Perpendicular nave, with Early English portions, of the priory church of
  an Augustinian foundation of the time of Henry I. There remains also the
  Perpendicular gateway, serving as the town-hall. The founder of the
  priory was Walter de Gaunt, about 1114, and the institution flourished
  until 1537, when the last prior was executed for taking part in the
  Pilgrimage of Grace. A Congregational society was founded in 1662, and
  its old church, dating from 1702, stood until 1906. At Bridlington Quay
  there is excellent sea-bathing, and the parade and ornamental gardens
  provide pleasant promenades. Extensive works have been carried out along
  the sea front. There is a chalybeate spring. The harbour is enclosed by
  two stone piers, and there is good anchorage in the bay. The municipal
  borough is under a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors, and has an area
  of 2751 acres.</p>
      <p>The mention of four burgesses at Bridlington (Brellington, Burlington)
  in the Domesday survey shows it to have been a borough before the
  Conquest. With the rest of the north of England, Bridlington suffered
  from the ravages of the Normans, and decreased in value from Â£32 in the
  reign of Edward the Confessor, when it formed part of the possessions of
  Earl Morcar, to 8s. at the time of the Domesday survey. By that time it
  was in the hands of the king by the forfeiture of Earl Morcar. It was
  granted by William II. to Gilbert de Gaunt, whose son and heir Walter
  founded the priory and endowed it with the manor of Bridlington and other
  lands. From this date the importance of the town steadily increased.
  Henry I. and several succeeding kings confirmed Walter de Gaunt's gift,
  Stephen granting in addition the right to have a port. In 1546 Henry IV.
  granted the prior and convent exemption from fifteenths, tenths and
  subsidies, in return for prayer for himself and his queen in every mass
  sung at the high altar. After the Dissolution the manor remained with the
  crown until 1624, when Charles I. granted it to Sir John Ramsey, whose
  brother and heir, Sir George Ramsey, sold it in 1633 to thirteen
  inhabitants of the town on behalf of all the tenants of the manor. The
  thirteen lords were assisted by twelve other inhabitants chosen by the
  freeholders, and when the number of lords was reduced to six, seven
  others were chosen from the assistants. A chief lord was chosen every
  year. This system still holds good. It is evident from the fact of
  thirteen inhabitants being allowed to hold the manor that the town had
  some kind of incorporation in the 17th century, although its
  incorporation charter was not granted until 1899, when it was created a
  municipal borough. In 1200 King John granted the prior of Bridlington a
  weekly market on Saturday and an annual fair on the vigil, feast and
  morrow of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. Henry VI. in 1446 granted
  the prior three new fairs yearly on the vigil, day and morrow of the
  Nativity of the Virgin Mary, the Deposition of St John, late prior of
  Bridlington, and the Translation of the same St John. All fairs and
  markets were sold with the manor to the inhabitants of the town.</p>
