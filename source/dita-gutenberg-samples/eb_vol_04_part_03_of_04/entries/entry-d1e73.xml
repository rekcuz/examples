   <title>BRESCIA</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRESCIA--> (anc. <i>Brixia</i>), a city and episcopal see of
  Lombardy, Italy, the capital of the province of Brescia, finely situated
  at the foot of the Alps, 52 m. E. of Milan and 40 m. W. of Verona by
  rail. Pop. (1901) town, 42,495; commune, 72,731. The plan of the city is
  rectangular, and the streets intersect at right angles, a peculiarity
  handed down from Roman times, though the area enclosed by the medieval
  walls is larger than that of the Roman town, which occupied the eastern
  portion of the present one. The Piazza del Museo marks the site of the
  forum, and the museum on its north side is ensconced in a Corinthian
  temple with three <i>cellae</i>, by some attributed to Hercules, but more
  probably the Capitolium of the city, erected by Vespasian in <ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph> 73 (if the inscription really belongs to the
  building; cf. Th. Mommsen in <i>Corp. Inscrip. Lat.</i> v. No. 4312,
  Berlin, 1872), and excavated in 1823. It contains a famous bronze statue
  of Victory, found in 1826. Scanty remains of a building on the south side
  of the forum, called the <i>curia</i>, but which may be a basilica, and
  of the theatre, on the east of the temple, still exist.</p>
      <p>Brescia contains many interesting medieval buildings. The castle, at
  the north-east angle of the town, commands a fine view. It is now a
  military prison. The old cathedral is a round domed structure of the 10th
  (?) century erected over an early Christian basilica, which has forty-two
  ancient columns; and the Broletto, adjoining the new cathedral (a
  building of 1604) on the north, is a massive building of the 12th and
  13th centuries (the original town hall, now the prefecture and law
  courts), with a lofty tower. There are also remains of the convent of S.
  Salvatore, founded by Desiderius, king of Lombardy, including three
  churches, two of which now contain the fine medieval museum, which
  possesses good ivories. The church of S. Francesco has a Gothic façade
  and cloisters. There are also some good Renaissance palaces and other
  buildings, including the Municipio, begun in 1492 and completed by Jacopo
  Sansovino in 1554-1574. This is a magnificent structure, with fine
  ornamentation. The church of S. Maria dei Miracoli (1488-1523) is also
  noteworthy for its general effect and for the richness of its details,
  especially of the reliefs on the façade. Many other churches, and the
  picture gallery (Galleria Martinengo), contain fine works of the painters
  of the Brescian school, Alessandro Bonvicino (generally known as
  Moretto), Girolamo Romanino and Moretto's pupil, Giovanni Battista
  Moroni. The Biblioteca Queriniana contains early MSS., a 14th-century MS.
  of Dante, &amp;c., and some rare incunabula. The city is well supplied
  with water, and has no less than seventy-two public fountains. Brescia
  has considerable factories of iron ware, particularly fire-arms and
  weapons (one of the government small arms factories being situated here),
  also of woollens, linens and silks, matches, candles, &amp;c. The stone
  quarries of Mazzano, 8 m. east of Brescia, supplied material for the
  monument to Victor Emmanuel II. and other buildings in Rome. Brescia is
  situated on the main railway line between Milan and Verona, and has
  branch railways to Iseo, Parma, Cremona and (via Rovato) to Bergamo, and
  steam tramways to Mantua, Soncino, Ponte Toscolano and Cardone
  Valtrompia.</p>
      <p>The ancient Celtic Brixia, a town of the Cenomani, became Roman in 225
  <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph>, when the Cenomani submitted to Rome.
  Augustus founded a civil (not a military) colony here in 27 <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph>, and he and Tiberius constructed an aqueduct to
  supply it. In 452 it was plundered by Attila, but was the seat of a duchy
  in the Lombard period. From 1167 it was one of the most active members of
  the Lombard League. In 1258 it fell into the hands of Eccelino of Verona,
  and belonged to the Scaligers (della Scala) until 1421, when it came
  under the Visconti of Milan, and in 1426 under Venice. Early in the 16th
  century it was one of the wealthiest cities of Lombardy, but has never
  recovered from its sack by the French under Gaston de Foix in 1512. It
  belonged to Venice until 1797, when it came under Austrian dominion; it
  revolted in 1848, and again in 1849, being the only Lombard town to rally
  to Charles Albert in the latter year, but was taken after ten days'
  obstinate street fighting by the Austrians under Haynau.</p>
