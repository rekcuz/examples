   <body>
      <p><!--BRIHASPATI,--> or <ph outputclass="sc">Brahmanaspati</ph> ("god of
  strength"), a deity of importance in early Hindu mythology. In the
  Rigveda he is represented as the god of prayer, aiding Indra in his
  conquest of the cloud-demon, and at times appears to be identified with
  Agni, god of fire. He is the offspring of Heaven and Earth, the two
  worlds; is the inspirer of prayer and the guide and protector of the
  pious. He is pictured as having seven mouths, a hundred wings and horns
  and is armed with bow and arrows and an axe. He rides in a chariot drawn
  by red horses. In the later scriptures he is represented as a Rishi or
  seer.</p>
