   <title>BROMLITE</title>

      <p><!--BROMLITE-->, a member of the aragonite group of minerals. It
  consists of an isomorphous mixture of calcium and barium carbonates in
  various proportions, (Ca, Ba) CO<sub>3</sub>, and thus differs chemically
  from barytocalcite (<i>q.v.</i>) which is a double salt of these
  carbonates in equal molecular proportions. Being isomorphous with
  aragonite, it crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, but simple
  crystals are not known. The crystals are invariably complex twins, and
  have the form of doubly terminated pseudo-hexagonal pyramids, like those
  of witherite but more acute; the faces are horizontally striated and are
  divided down their centre by a twin-suture, as represented in the
  adjoining figure. The examination in polarized light of a transverse
  section shows that each compound crystal is built up of six differently
  orientated individuals arranged in twelve segments. The crystals are
  translucent and white, sometimes with a shade of pink. Sp. gr. 3.706;
  hardness 4-4Â½. The mineral has been found at only two localities, both of
  which are in the north of England. At the Fallowfield lead mine, near
  Hexham in Northumberland, it is associated with witherite; and at Bromley
  Hill, near Alston in Cumberland, it occurs in veins with galena. The
  species was named bromlite by T. Thomson in 1837, and alstonite by A.
  Breithaupt in 1841, both of which names, derived from the locality, have
  been in common use.</p>
