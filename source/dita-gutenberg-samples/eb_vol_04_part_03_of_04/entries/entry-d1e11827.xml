   <body>
      <p><!--BRIENZ, LAKE OF,--> in the Swiss canton of Bern, the first lake
  into which the river Aar expands. It lies in a deep hollow between the
  village of Brienz on the east (2580 inhabitants, the <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page563">[v.04 p.0563]</ph>chief
  centre of the Swiss wood-carving industry) and, on the west, Bönigen
  (1515 inhabitants), close to Interlaken. Its length is about 9 m., its
  width 1½ m., and its maximum depth 856 ft., while its area is 11½ sq. m.,
  and the surface is 1857 ft. above the sea-level. On the south shore are
  the Giessbach Falls and the hamlet of Iseltwald. On the north shore are a
  few small villages. The character of the lake is gloomy and sad as
  compared with its neighbour, that of Thun. Its chief affluent is the
  Lütschine (flowing from the valleys of Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen).
  The first steamer was placed on the lake in 1839.</p>
