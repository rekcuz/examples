   <title>BRONZING</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRONZING,--> a process by which a bronze-like surface is imparted
  to objects of metal, plaster, wood, &amp;c. On metals a green bronze
  colour is sometimes produced by the action of such substances as vinegar,
  dilute nitric acid and sal-ammoniac. An antique appearance may be given
  to new bronze articles by brushing over the clean bright metal with a
  solution of sal-ammoniac and salt of sorrel in vinegar, and rubbing the
  surface dry, the operation being repeated as often as necessary. Another
  solution for the same purpose is made with sal-ammoniac, cream of tartar,
  common salt and silver nitrate. With a solution of platinic chloride
  almost any colour can be produced on copper, iron, brass or new bronze,
  according to the dilution and the number of applications. Articles of
  plaster and wood may be bronzed by coating them with size and then
  covering them with a bronze powder, such as Dutch metal, beaten into fine
  leaves and powdered. The bronzing of gun-barrels may be effected by the
  use of a strong solution of antimony trichloride.</p>
