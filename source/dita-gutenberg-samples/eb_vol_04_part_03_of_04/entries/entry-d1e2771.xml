   <title>BREWSTER, SIR DAVID</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BREWSTER, SIR DAVID--> (1781-1868), Scottish natural philosopher,
  was born on the 11th of December 1781 at Jedburgh, where his father, a
  teacher of high reputation, was rector of the grammar school. At the
  early age of twelve he was sent to the university of Edinburgh, being
  intended for the clerical profession. Even before this, however, he had
  shown a strong inclination for natural science, and this had been
  fostered by his intimacy with a "self-taught philosopher, astronomer and
  mathematician," as Sir Walter Scott called him, of great local
  fame—James Veitch of Inchbonny, who was particularly skilful in
  making telescopes. Though he duly finished his theological course and was
  licensed to preach, Brewster's preference for other pursuits prevented
  him from engaging in the active duties of his profession. In 1799 he was
  induced by his fellow-student, Henry Brougham, to study the diffraction
  of light. The results of his investigations were communicated from time
  to time in papers to the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> of London and
  other scientific journals, and were admirably and impartially summarized
  by James D. Forbes in his preliminary dissertation to the eighth edition
  of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>. The fact that other philosophers,
  notably Etienne Louis Malus and Augustin Fresnel, were pursuing the same
  investigations contemporaneously in France does not invalidate Brewster's
  claim to independent discovery, even though in one or two cases the
  priority must be assigned to others.</p>
      <p>The most important subjects of his inquiries are enumerated by Forbes
  under the following five heads:—(1) The laws of polarization by
  reflection and refraction, and other quantitative laws of phenomena; (2)
  The discovery of the polarizing structure induced by heat and pressure;
  (3) The discovery of crystals with two axes of double refraction, and
  many of the laws of their phenomena, including the connexion of optical
  structure and crystalline forms; (4) The laws of metallic reflection; (5)
  Experiments on the absorption of light. In this line of investigation the
  prime importance belongs to the discovery (1) of the connexion between
  the refractive index and the polarizing angle, (2) of biaxial crystals,
  and (3) of the production of double refraction by irregular heating.
  These discoveries were promptly recognized. So early as the year 1807 the
  degree of LL.D. was conferred upon Brewster by Marischal College,
  Aberdeen; in 1815 he was made a member of the Royal Society of London,
  and received the Copley medal; in 1818 he received the Rumford medal of
  the society; and in 1816 the French Institute awarded him one-half of the
  prize of three thousand francs for the two most important discoveries in
  physical science made in Europe during the two preceding years. Among the
  non-scientific public his fame was spread more effectually by his
  rediscovery about 1815 of the kaleidoscope, for which there was a great
  demand in both England and America. An instrument of higher interest, the
  stereoscope, which, though of much later date (1849-1850), may be
  mentioned here, since along with the kaleidoscope it did more than
  anything else to popularize his name, was not, as has often been
  asserted, the invention of Brewster. Sir Charles Wheatstone discovered
  its principle and applied it as early as 1838 to the construction of a
  cumbrous but effective instrument, in which the binocular pictures were
  made to combine by means of mirrors. To Brewster is due the merit of
  suggesting the use of lenses for the purpose of uniting the dissimilar
  pictures; and accordingly the lenticular stereoscope may fairly be said
  to be his invention. A much more valuable practical result of Brewster's
  optical researches was the improvement of the British lighthouse system.
  It is true that the dioptric apparatus was perfected independently by
  Fresnel, who had also the satisfaction of being the first to put it into
  operation. But it is indisputable that Brewster was earlier in the field
  than Fresnel; that he described the dioptric apparatus in 1812; that he
  pressed its adoption on those in authority at least as early as 1820, two
  years before Fresnel suggested it; and that it was finally introduced
  into British lighthouses mainly by his persistent efforts.</p>
      <p>Brewster's own discoveries, important though they were, were not his
  only, perhaps not even his chief, service to science. He began literary
  work in 1799 as a regular contributor to the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>,
  of which he acted as editor at the age of twenty. In 1807 he undertook
  the editorship of the newly projected <i>Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</i>, of
  which the first part appeared in 1808, and the last not until 1830. The
  work was strongest in the scientific department, and many of its most
  valuable articles were from the pen of the editor. At a later period he
  was one of the leading contributors to the <i>Encyclopaedia
  Britannica</i> (seventh and eighth editions), the articles on
  Electricity, Hydrodynamics, Magnetism, Microscope, Optics, Stereoscope,
  Voltaic Electricity, &amp;c., being from his pen. In 1819 Brewster
  undertook further editorial work by establishing, in conjunction with
  Robert Jameson (1774-1854), the <i>Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</i>,
  which took the place of the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>. The first ten
  volumes (1819-1824) were published under the joint editorship of Brewster
  and Jameson, the remaining four volumes (1825-1826) being edited by
  Jameson alone. After parting company with Jameson, Brewster started the
  <i>Edinburgh Journal of Science</i> in 1824, sixteen volumes of which
  appeared under his editorship during the years 1824-1832, with very many
  articles from his own pen. To the transactions of various learned
  societies he contributed from first to last between three and four
  hundred papers, and few of his contemporaries wrote so much for the
  various reviews. In the <i>North British Review</i> alone seventy-five
  articles of his appeared. A list of his larger separate works will be
  found below. Special mention, however, must be made of the most important
  of them all—his biography of Sir Isaac Newton. In 1831 he published
  a short popular account of the philosopher's life in Murray's <i>Family
  Library</i>; but it was not until 1855 that he was able to issue the much
  fuller <i>Memoirs of the Life, Writings and Discoveries of Sir Isaac
  Newton</i>, a work which embodied the results of more than twenty years'
  patient investigation of original manuscripts and all other available
  sources.</p>
      <p>Brewster's relations as editor brought him into frequent communication
  with the most eminent scientific men, and he was naturally among the
  first to recognize the benefit that would accrue from regular intercourse
  among workers in the field of science. In an article in the <i>Quarterly
  Review</i> he threw out a suggestion for "an association of our nobility,
  clergy, gentry and philosophers," which was taken up by others and found
  speedy realization in the British Association for the Advancement of <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page514">[v.04
  p.0514]</ph>Science. Its first meeting was held at York in 1831; and
  Brewster, along with Charles Babbage and Sir John F. W. Herschel, had the
  chief part in shaping its constitution. In the same year in which the
  British Association held its first meeting, Brewster received the honour
  of knighthood and the decoration of the Guelphic order of Hanover. In
  1838 he was appointed principal of the united colleges of St Salvator and
  St Leonard, St Andrews. In 1849 he acted as president of the British
  Association and was elected one of the eight foreign associates of the
  Institute of France in succession to J.J. Berzelius; and ten years later
  he accepted the office of principal of the university of Edinburgh, the
  duties of which he discharged until within a few months of his death,
  which took place at Allerly, Melrose, on the 10th of February 1868.</p>
      <p>In estimating Brewster's place among scientific discoverers the chief
  thing to be borne in mind is that the bent of his genius was not
  characteristically mathematical. His method was empirical, and the laws
  which he established were generally the result of repeated experiment. To
  the ultimate explanation of the phenomena with which he dealt he
  contributed nothing, and it is noteworthy in this connexion that if he
  did not maintain to the end of his life the corpuscular theory he never
  explicitly adopted the undulatory theory of light. Few will be inclined
  to dispute the verdict of Forbes:—"His scientific glory is
  different in kind from that of Young and Fresnel; but the discoverer of
  the law of polarization of biaxial crystals, of optical mineralogy, and
  of double refraction by compression, will always occupy a foremost rank
  in the intellectual history of the age." In addition to the various works
  of Brewster already noticed, the following may be mentioned:—Notes
  and Introduction to Carlyle's translation of Legendre's <i>Elements of
  Geometry</i> (1824); <i>Treatise on Optics</i> (1831); <i>Letters on
  Natural Magic,</i> addressed to Sir Walter Scott (1831); <i>The Martyrs
  of Science, or the Lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler</i> (1841);
  <i>More Worlds than One</i> (1854).</p>
