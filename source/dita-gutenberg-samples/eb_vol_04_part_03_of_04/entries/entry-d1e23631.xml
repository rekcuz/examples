      <p><!--BROWN, THOMAS--> (1663-1704), English satirist, of "facetious
  memory" as Addison designates him, was the son of a farmer at Shifnal, in
  Shropshire, and was born in 1663. He was entered in 1678 at Christ
  Church, Oxford, where he is said to have escaped expulsion by the famous
  lines beginning, "I do not love thee, Dr Fell." He was for three years
  schoolmaster at Kingston-on-Thames, and afterwards settled in London.
  Under the pseudonym of Dudly Tomkinson he wrote a satire on Dryden,
  <i>The Reasons of Mr Bays changing his Religion: considered in a Dialogue
  between Crites, Eugenius and Mr Bays</i>, with two other parts having
  separate titles (1688-1690, republished with additions in 1691). He was
  the author of a great variety of poems, letters, dialogues and lampoons,
  full of humour and erudition, but coarse and scurrilous. His writings
  have a certain value for the knowledge they display of low life in
  London. He died on the 16th of June 1704, and was buried in the cloister
  of Westminster Abbey.</p>
      <p>His collected works were published in 1707-1708. The second volume
  contains a collection of <i>Letters from the Dead to the Living</i>, some
  of which are translated from the French. His <i>Comical Romance done into
  English</i> (1772, the <i>Roman Comique</i> of Scarron) was reprinted in
  1892.</p>
