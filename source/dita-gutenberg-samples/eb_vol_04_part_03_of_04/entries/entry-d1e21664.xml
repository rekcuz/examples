   <title>BRONZE AGE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRONZE AGE,--> the name given by archaeologists to that stage in
  human culture, intermediate between the Stone and Iron Ages, when
  weapons, utensils and implements were, as a general rule, made of bronze.
  The term has no absolute chronological value, but marks a period of
  civilization through which it is believed that most races passed at one
  time or another. The "finds" of stone and bronze, of bronze and iron, and
  even of stone and iron implements together in tumuli and sepulchral
  mounds, suggest that in many countries the three stages in man's progress
  overlapped. From the similarity of types of weapons and implements of the
  period found throughout Europe a relatively synchronous commencement has
  been inferred for the Bronze Age in Europe, fixed by most authorities at
  between 2000 <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph> to 1800 <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph> But it must have been earlier in some countries,
  and is certainly known to have been later in others; while the Mexicans
  and Peruvians were still in their bronze age in recent times. Not a few
  archaeologists have denied that there ever was a distinct Bronze Age.
  They have found their chief argument in the fact that weapons of these
  ages have been found side by side in prehistoric burial-places. But when
  it is admitted that the ages must have overlapped, it is fairly easy to
  undertand the mixed "finds." The beginning, the prevalence and duration
  of the Bronze Age in each country would have been ordered by the
  accessibility of the metals which form the alloy. Thus in some lands
  bronze may have continued to be a substance of extreme value until the
  Iron Age was reached, and in tumuli in which more than one body was
  interred, as was frequently the case, it would only be with the remains
  of the richer tenants of the tomb that the more valuable objects would be
  placed. There is, moreover, much reason to believe that sepulchral mounds
  were opened from age to age and fresh interments made, and in such a
  practice would be found a simple explanation of the mixing of implements.
  Another curious fact has been seized on by those who argue against the
  existence of a Bronze Age. Among all the "finds" examined in Europe there
  is a most remarkable absence of copper implements. The sources of tin in
  Europe are practically restricted to Cornwall and Saxony. How then are we
  to explain on the one hand the apparent stride made by primitive man when
  from a Stone Age civilization he passed to a comparatively advanced
  metallurgical skill? On the other, how account for a comparatively
  synchronous commencement of bronze civilization when one at least of the
  metals needed for the alloy would have been naturally difficult of
  access, if not unknown to many races? The answer is that there can be but
  little doubt that the knowledge of bronze came to the races of Europe
  from outside. Either by the Phoenicians or by the Greeks metallurgy was
  taught to men who no sooner recognized the nature and malleable
  properties of copper than they learnt that by application of heat a
  substance could be manufactured with tin far better suited to their
  purposes. Copper would thus have been but seldom used unalloyed; and the
  relatively synchronous appearance of bronze in Europe, and the scanty
  "finds" of copper implements, are explained. We may conclude then that
  there was a Bronze Age in most countries; that it was the direct result
  of increasing intercommunication of races and the spread of commerce; and
  that the discovery of metals was due to information brought to Stone-Age
  man in Europe by races which were already skilful metallurgists.</p>
      <p>The Bronze Age in Europe is characterized by weapons, utensils and
  implements, distinct in design and size from those in use in the
  preceding or succeeding stage of man's civilization. Moreover—and
  this has been employed as an argument in favour of the foreign origin of
  the knowledge of bronze—all the <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page641">[v.04 p.0641]</ph>objects in one
  part of Europe are identical in pattern and size with those found in
  another part. The implements of the Bronze Age include swords, awls,
  knives, gouges, hammers, daggers and arrow-heads. A remarkable
  confirmation of the theory that the Bronze Age culture came from the East
  is to be found in the patterns of the arms, which are distinctly
  oriental; while the handles of swords and daggers are so narrow and short
  as to make it unlikely that they would be made for use by the
  large-handed races of Europe. The Bronze Age is also characterized by the
  fact that cremation was the mode of disposal of the dead, whereas in the
  Stone Age burial was the rule. Barrows and sepulchral mounds strictly of
  the Bronze Age are smaller and less imposing than those of the Stone Age.
  Besides varied and beautiful weapons, frequently exhibiting high
  workmanship, amulets, coronets, diadems of solid gold, and vases of
  elegant form and ornamentation in gold and bronze are found in the
  barrows. These latter appear to have been used as tribal or family
  cemeteries. In Denmark as many as seventy deposits of burnt bones have
  been found in a single mound, indicating its use through a long
  succession of years. The ornamentation of the period is as a rule
  confined to spirals, bosses and concentric circles. What is remarkable is
  that the swords not only show the design of the cross in the shape of the
  handle, but also in tracery what is believed to be an imitation of the
  Svastika, that ancient Aryan symbol which was probably the first to be
  made with a definite intention and a consecutive meaning. The pottery is
  all "hand-made," and the bulk of the objects excavated are cinerary urns,
  usually found full of burnt bones. These vary from 12 to 18 in. in
  height. Their decoration is confined to a band round the upper part of
  the pot, or often only a projecting flange lapped round the whole rim. A
  few have small handles, formed of pierced knobs of clay and sometimes
  projecting rolls of clay, looped, as it were, all round the urn. The
  ornamentation consists of dots, zigzags, chevrons or crosses. The lines
  were frequently made by pressing a twisted thong of skin against the
  moist clay; the patterns in all cases being stamped into the pot before
  it was hardened by fire.</p>
