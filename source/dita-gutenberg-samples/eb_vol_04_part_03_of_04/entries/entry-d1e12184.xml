      <p><!--BRIGGS, HENRY--> (1556-1630), English mathematician, was born at
  Warley Wood, near Halifax, in Yorkshire. He graduated at St John's
  College, Cambridge, in 1581, and obtained a fellowship in 1588. In 1592
  he was made reader of the physical lecture founded by Dr Thomas Linacre,
  and in 1596 first professor of geometry in Gresham House (afterwards
  College), London. In his lectures at Gresham House he proposed the
  alteration of the scale of logarithms from the hyperbolic form which John
  Napier had given them, to that in which unity is assumed as the logarithm
  of the ratio of ten to one; and soon afterwards he wrote to the inventor
  on the subject. In 1616 he paid a visit to Napier at Edinburgh in order
  to discuss the suggested change; and next year he repeated his visit for
  a similar purpose. During these conferences the alteration proposed by
  Briggs was agreed upon; and on his return from his second visit to
  Edinburgh in 1617 he accordingly published the first chiliad of his
  logarithms. (See <ph outputclass="sc">Napier, John</ph>.) In 1619 he was
  appointed Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford, and resigned his
  professorship of Gresham College on the 25th of July 1620. Soon after his
  settlement at Oxford he was incorporated master of arts. In 1622 he
  published a small tract on the <i>North-West Passage to the South Seas,
  through the Continent of Virginia and Hudson's Bay</i>; and in 1624 his
  <i>Arithmetica Logarithmica</i>, in folio, a work containing the
  logarithms of thirty thousand natural numbers to fourteen places of
  figures besides the index. He also completed a table of logarithmic sines
  and tangents for the hundredth part of every degree to fourteen places of
  figures besides the index, with a table of natural sines to fifteen
  places, and the tangents and secants for the same to ten places; all of
  which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title
  of <i>Trigonometria Britannica</i> (see <ph outputclass="sc">Table,
  Mathematical</ph>). Briggs died on the 26th of January 1630, and was
  buried in Merton College chapel, Oxford. Dr Smith, in his <i>Lives of the
  Gresham Professors</i>, characterizes him as a man of great probity, a
  contemner of riches, and contented with his own station, preferring a
  studious retirement to all the splendid circumstances of life.</p>
      <p>His works are: <i>A Table to find the Height of the Pole, the
  Magnetical Declination being given</i> (London, 1602, 4to); "Tables for
  the Improvement of Navigation," printed in the second edition of Edward
  Wright's treatise entitled <i>Certain Errors in Navigation detected and
  corrected</i> (London, 1610, 4to); <i>A Description of an Instrumental
  Table to find the part proportional, devised by Mr Edward Wright</i>
  (London, 1616 and 1618, 12mo); <i>Logarithmorum Chilias prima</i>
  (London, 1617, 8vo); <i>Lucubrationes et Annotationes in opera posthuma
  J. Neperi</i> (Edinburgh, 1619, 4to); <i>Euclidis Elementorum VI. libri
  priores</i> (London, 1620. folio); <i>A Treatise on the North-West
  Passage to the South Sea</i> (London, 1622, 4to), reprinted in Purchas's
  <i>Pilgrims</i>, vol. iii. p. 852; <i>Arithmetica Logarithmica</i>
  (London, 1624, folio); <i>Trigonometria Britannica</i> (Goudae, 1663,
  folio); two <i>Letters</i> to Archbishop Usher; <i>Mathematica ab
  Antiquis minus cognita</i>. Some other works, as his <i>Commentaries on
  the Geometry of Peter Ramus</i>, and <i>Remarks on the Treatise of
  Longomontanus respecting the Quadrature of the Circle</i>, have not been
  published.</p>
