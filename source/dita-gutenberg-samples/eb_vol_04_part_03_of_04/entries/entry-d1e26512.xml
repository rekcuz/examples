   <title>BRUSH, GEORGE DE FOREST</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRUSH, GEORGE DE FOREST--> (1855- ), American painter, was born at
  Shelbyville, Tennessee, on the 28th of September 1855. He was a pupil of
  J.L. Gérôme at Paris, and became a member of the National Academy of
  Design, New York. From 1883 onwards, he attracted much attention by his
  paintings of North American Indians, his "Moose Hunt," "Aztec King" and
  "Mourning her Brave" achieving great popularity and showing the strong
  influence of Gérôme. These <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page692">[v.04 p.0692]</ph>were followed by picture
  portraits, particularly of mother and child, largely suggestive of the
  work of the Dutch, Flemish and German masters, carefully arranged as to
  line and mass, and worked out in great detail with consummate technical
  skill. Several of his paintings have for subject his own children and his
  wife; one of these is in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.</p>
