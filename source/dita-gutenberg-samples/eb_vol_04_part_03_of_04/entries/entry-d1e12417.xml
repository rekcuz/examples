      <p><!--BRIGNOLES,--> a town in the department of Var in the S.E. of
  France, 36 m. by rail N. of Toulon. Pop. (1906) 3639. It is built at a
  height of 754 ft. above the sea-level, in a fertile valley, and on the
  right bank of the Carami river. It contains the old summer palace of the
  counts of Provence, and has an active trade, especially in prunes, known
  as <i>prunes de Brignoles</i>. Its old name was <i>Villa Puerorum</i>, as
  the children of the counts of Provence were often brought up here. It was
  sacked on several occasions during the religious wars in the 16th
  century. Twelve miles to the N.W. is St Maximin (with a fine medieval
  church), which is one of the best starting-points for the most famous
  pilgrimage resort in Provence, the Sainte Baume, wherein St Mary
  Magdalene is said to have taken refuge. This is 20 m. distant by
  road.</p>
