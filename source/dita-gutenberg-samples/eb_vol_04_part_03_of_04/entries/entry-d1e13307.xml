      <p><!--BRISTOL,--> a city of Sullivan county, Tennessee, and Washington
  county, Virginia, U.S.A., 130 m. N.E. of Knoxville, Tennessee, at an
  altitude of about 1700 ft. Pop. (1880) 3209; (1890) 6226; (1900) 9850
  (including 1981 negroes); (1910) 13,395, of whom 7148 were in Tennessee
  and 6247 were in Virginia. Bristol is served by the Holston Valley, the
  Southern, the Virginia &amp; South-Western, and the Norfolk &amp; Western
  railways, and is a railway centre of some importance. It is near the
  great mineral deposits of Virginia, Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky
  and North Carolina; an important distributing point for iron, coal and
  coke; and has tanneries and lumber mills, iron furnaces, tobacco
  factories, furniture factories and packing houses. It is the seat of
  Sullins College (Methodist Episcopal, South; 1870) for women, and of the
  Virginia Institute for Women (Baptist, 1884), both in the state of
  Virginia, and of a normal college for negroes, on the Tennessee side of
  the state line. The Tennessee-Virginia boundary line runs through the
  principal street, dividing the place into two separate corporations, the
  Virginia part, which before 1890 (when it was chartered as a city) was
  known as Goodson, being administratively independent of the county in
  which it is situated. Bristol was settled about 1835, and the town of
  Bristol, Tennessee, was first incorporated in 1856.</p>
