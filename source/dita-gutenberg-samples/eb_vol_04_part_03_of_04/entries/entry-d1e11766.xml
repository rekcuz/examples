   <title>BRIEG</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIEG,--> often now spelt <ph outputclass="sc">Brig</ph> (Fr.
  <i>Brigue</i>, Ital. <i>Briga</i>), a picturesque small town in the Swiss
  canton of the Valais, situated at the foot of the northern slope of the
  Simplon Pass, on the right bank of the Saltine stream, and a little above
  its junction with the Rhone. Its older houses are very Italian in
  appearance, while its most prominent buildings (castle, former Jesuits'
  college and Ursuline convent) all date from the 17th century, and are due
  to the generosity of a single member of the local Stockalper family. The
  prosperity of Brieg is bound up with the Simplon Pass (<i>q.v.</i>), so
  that it gradually supplanted the more ancient village of Naters opposite,
  becoming a separate parish (the church is at Glis, a few minutes from the
  town) in 1517. Its medieval name was <i>Briga dives</i>. The opening of
  the carriage road across the Simplon (1807) and of the tunnel beneath the
  pass (1906), as well as the fact that above Brieg is the steeper and less
  fertile portion of the Upper Valais (now much frequented by tourists),
  have greatly increased the importance and size of the town. The opening
  of the railway tunnel beneath the LÃ¶tschen Pass, affording direct
  communication with Bern and the Bernese Oberland, is calculated still
  further to contribute to its prosperity. The new town extends below the
  old one and is closer to the right bank of the Rhone. In 1900 the
  population was 2182, almost all Romanists, while 1316 were
  German-speaking, 719 Italian-speaking (the Simplon tunnel workmen), and
  142 French-speaking, one person only speaking Romonsch.</p>
