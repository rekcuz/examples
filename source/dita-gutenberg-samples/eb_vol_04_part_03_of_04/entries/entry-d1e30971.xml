   <body>
      <p><!--BUCKNER, SIMON BOLIVAR--> (1823- ), American soldier and political
  leader, was born in Hart county, Kentucky, on the 1st of April 1823. He
  graduated at West Point in 1844, and was assistant professor of
  geography, history and ethics there in 1845-1846. He fought in several
  battles of the Mexican War, received the brevet of first lieutenant for
  gallantry at Churubusco, where he was wounded, and later, after the
  storming of Chapultepec, received the brevet of captain. In 1848-1850 he
  was assistant instructor of infantry tactics at West Point. During the
  succeeding five years he was in the recruiting service, on frontier duty,
  and finally in the subsistence department. He resigned from the army in
  March 1855. During the futile attempt of Governor Beriah Magoffin to
  maintain Kentucky in a position of neutrality, he was commander of the
  state <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page733">[v.04
  p.0733]</ph>guard; but in September 1861, after the entry of Union
  forces into the state, he openly espoused the Confederate cause and was
  commissioned brigadier-general, later becoming lieutenant-general. He was
  third in command of Fort Donelson at the time of General Grant's attack
  (February 1862), and it fell to him, after the escape of Generals Floyd
  and Pillow, to surrender the post with its large garrison and valuable
  supplies. General Buckner was exchanged in August of the same year, and
  subsequently served under General Bragg in the invasion of Kentucky and
  the campaign of Chickamauga. He was governor of Kentucky in 1887-1891,
  was a member of the Kentucky constitutional convention of 1890, and in
  1896 was the candidate of the National or "Gold" Democrats for
  vice-president of the United States.</p>
