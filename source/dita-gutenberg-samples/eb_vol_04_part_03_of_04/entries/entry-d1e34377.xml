   <title>BUITENZORG</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUITENZORG,--> a hill station in the residency of Batavia, island
  of Java, Dutch East Indies. It is beautifully situated among the hills at
  the foot of the Salak volcano, about 860 ft. above sea-level, and has a
  cool and healthy climate. Buitenzorg is the usual residence of the
  governor-general of the Dutch East Indies, and is further remarkable on
  account of its splendid botanical garden and for its popularity as a
  health resort. The botanic gardens are among the finest in the world;
  they originally formed a part of the park attached to the palace of the
  governor-general, and were established in 1817. Under J.S. Teysmann, who
  became <i>hortulanus</i> in 1830, the collection was extended, and in
  1868 was recognized as a government institution with a director. Between
  this and 1880 a museum, a school of agriculture, and a culture garden
  were added, and since then library, botanical, chemical, and
  pharmacological laboratories, and a herbarium have been established. The
  palace of the governor-general was founded by Governor-General van Imhoff
  in 1744, and rebuilt after being destroyed by an earthquake in 1834.
  Buitenzorg is also the seat of the general secretary of the state railway
  and of the department of mines. Buitenzorg, which is called Bogor by the
  natives, was once the capital of the princess of Pajajaram. Close by, at
  <i>Bata Tulis</i> ("inscribed stone"), are some Hindu remains. The
  district of Buitenzorg (till 1866 an assistant residency) forms the
  southern part of the residency of Batavia, with an area of 1447 sq. m. It
  occupies the northern slopes of a range of hills separating it from
  Preanger, and has a fertile soil. Tea, coffee, cinchona, sugar-cane,
  rice, nutmegs, cloves and pepper are cultivated.</p>
