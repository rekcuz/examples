   <title>BRONCHITIS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRONCHITIS,--> the name given to inflammation of the mucous
  membrane of the bronchial tubes (see <ph outputclass="sc">Respiratory
  System</ph>: <i>Pathology</i>). Two main varieties are described,
  specific and non-specific bronchitis. The bronchitis which occurs in
  infectious or specific disorders, as diphtheria, influenza, measles,
  pneumonia, &amp;c., due to the micro-organisms observed in these
  diseases, is known as specific; whereas that which results from extension
  from above, or from chemical or mechanical irritation, is known as
  non-specific. It is convenient to describe it, however, under the
  chemical divisions of <i>acute</i> and <i>chronic</i> bronchitis.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Acute bronchitis</i>, like other inflammatory affections of the
  chest, generally arises as the result of exposure to cold, particularly
  if accompanied with damp, or of sudden change from a heated to a cool
  atmosphere. The symptoms vary according to the severity of the attack,
  and more especially according to the extent to which the inflammatory
  action spreads in the bronchial tubes. The disease usually manifests
  itself at first in the form of a catarrh, or common cold; but the
  accompanying feverishness and general constitutional disturbance proclaim
  the attack to be something more severe, and symptoms denoting the onset
  of bronchitis soon present themselves. A short, painful, dry cough,
  accompanied with rapid and wheezing respiration, a feeling of rawness and
  pain in the throat and behind the breast bone, and of oppression or
  tightness throughout the chest, mark the early stages of the disease. In
  some cases, from the first, symptoms of the form of asthma (<i>q.v.</i>)
  known as the <i>bronchitic</i> are superadded, and greatly aggravate the
  patient's suffering.</p>

      </p>
      <p>After a few days expectoration begins to come with the cough, at first
  scanty and viscid or frothy, but soon becoming copious and of purulent
  character. In general, after free expectoration has been established the
  more urgent and painful symptoms abate; and while the cough may persist
  for a length of time, often extending to three or four weeks, in the
  majority of instances convalescence advances, and the patient is
  ultimately restored to health, although there is not unfrequently left a
  tendency to a recurrence of the disease on exposure to its exciting
  causes.</p>
      <p>When the ear or the stethoscope is applied to the chest of a person
  suffering from such an attack as that now described, there are heard in
  the earlier stages snoring or cooing sounds, mixed up with others of
  wheezing or fine whistling quality, accompanying respiration. These are
  denominated dry sounds, and they are occasionally so abundant and
  distinct, as to convey their vibrations to the hand applied to the chest,
  as well as to be audible to a bystander at some distance. As the disease
  progresses these sounds become to a large extent replaced by others of
  crackling or bubbling character, which are termed moist sounds or râles.
  Both these kinds of abnormal sounds are readily explained by a reference
  to the pathological condition of the parts. One of the first effects of
  inflammation upon the bronchial mucous membrane is to cause some degree
  of swelling, which, together with the presence of a tough secretion
  closely adhering to it, tends to diminish the calibre of the tubes. The
  respired air as it passes over this surface gives rise to the dry or
  sonorous breath sounds, the coarser being generated in the large, and the
  finer or wheezing sounds in the small divisions of the bronchi. Before
  long, however, the discharge from the bronchial mucous membrane becomes
  more abundant and less glutinous, and accumulates in the tubes till
  dislodged by coughing. The respired air, as it passes through this fluid,
  causes the moist râles above described. In most instances both moist and
  dry sounds are heard abundantly in the same case, since different
  portions of the bronchial tubes are affected at different times in the
  course of the disease.</p>
      <p>Such are briefly the main characteristics presented by an ordinary
  attack of acute bronchitis running a favourable course. The case is,
  however, very different when the inflammation spreads into, or when it
  primarily affects, the minute ramifications of the bronchial tubes which
  are in immediate relation to the air-cells of the lungs, giving rise to
  that form of the disease known as <i>capillary bronchitis</i> or
  <i>broncho-pneumonia</i> (see <ph outputclass="sc">Respiratory System</ph>:
  <i>Pathology</i>; and <ph outputclass="sc">Pneumonia</ph>). When this takes
  place all the symptoms already detailed become greatly intensified, and
  the patient's life is placed in imminent peril in consequence of the
  interruption to the entrance of air into the lungs, and thus to the due
  aeration of the blood. The feverishness and restlessness increase, the
  cough becomes incessant, the respiration extremely rapid and laboured,
  the nostrils dilating with each effort, and evidence of impending
  suffocation appears. The surface of the body is pale or dusky, the lips
  are livid, while breathing becomes increasingly difficult, and is
  attended with suffocative paroxysms which render the recumbent posture
  impossible. Unless speedy relief is obtained by successful efforts to
  clear the chest by coughing and expectoration, the patient's strength
  gives way, somnolence and delirium set in and death ensues. All this may
  be brought about in the space of a few days, and such cases, particularly
  among the very young, sometimes prove fatal within forty-eight hours.</p>
      <p>Acute bronchitis must at all times be looked upon as a severe and even
  serious ailment, but there are certain circumstances under which its
  occurrence is a matter of special anxiety to the physician. It is
  pre-eminently dangerous at the extremes of life, and mortality statistics
  show it to be one of the most fatal of the diseases of those periods.
  This is to be explained not only by the well-recognized fact that all
  acute diseases tell with great severity on the feeble frames alike of
  infants and aged people, but more particularly by the tendency which
  bronchitis undoubtedly has in attacking them to assume the capillary
  form, and when it does so to prove quickly fatal. The importance,
  therefore, of early attention to the slightest evidence of bronchitis
  among the very young or the aged can scarcely be overrated.</p>
      <p>Bronchitis is also apt to be very severe when it occurs in persons who
  are addicted to intemperance. Again, in those who suffer from any disease
  affecting directly or indirectly the respiratory functions, such as
  consumption or heart disease, the supervention of an attack of acute
  bronchitis is an alarming complication, increasing, as it necessarily
  does, the <ph outputclass="correction">embarrassment</ph> of breathing. The same remark is applicable to
  those numerous instances of its occurrence in children who are or have
  been suffering from such diseases as have always associated with them a
  certain degree of bronchial irritation, such as measles and
  whooping-cough.</p>
      <p>One other source of danger of a special character in bronchitis
  remains to be mentioned, viz. collapse of the lung. Occasionally a branch
  of a bronchial tube becomes plugged up with secretion, so that the area
  of the lung to which this branch conducts ceases to be inflated on
  inspiration. The small quantity of air imprisoned in the portion of lung
  gradually escapes, but no fresh air enters, and the part collapses and
  becomes of solid consistence. Increased difficulty of breathing is the
  result, and where a large portion of lung is affected by the plugging up
  of a large bronchus, a fatal result may rapidly follow, the danger being
  specially great in the case of children. Fortunately, the obstruction may
  sometimes be removed by vigorous coughing, and relief is then
  obtained.</p>
      <p>With respect to the treatment of acute bronchitis, in those mild cases
  which are more of the nature of a simple catarrh, little else will be
  found necessary than confinement in a warm room, or in bed, for a few
  days, and the use of light diet, together with warm diluent drinks.
  Additional measures are however called for when the disease is more
  markedly developed. Medicines to allay fever and promote perspiration are
  highly serviceable in the earlier stages. Later, with the view of
  soothing the pain of the cough, and favouring expectoration, mixtures of
  tolu, with the addition of some opiate, such as the ordinary paregorics,
  may be advantageously employed. The use of opium, however, in any form
  should not be resorted to in the case of young children without medical
  advice, since its action on them is much more potent and less under
  control than it is in adults. Not a few of the so-called "soothing
  mixtures" have been found to contain opium in quantity sufficient to
  prove dangerous when administered to children, and caution is necessary
  in using them.</p>
      <p>From the outset of the attack the employment of fomentations, or
  especially a turpentine stupe, gives great relief, and occasionally in
  the non-specific form this treatment, combined with a good dose of
  calomel and salts, may render the attack abortive. Some relief is always
  obtained by inhalations, and theoretically, an acute specific bronchitis
  should be successfully treated by inhalation of antiseptic and soothing
  remedies. In practice, however, it is found that the strength cannot be
  sufficiently strong to destroy the bacteria in the bronchial tubes.
  However, much relief is obtained from the use of steam atomizers filled
  with an aqueous solution of compound tincture of benzoin, creosote or
  guaiacol. A still more practicable means of introducing volatile
  antiseptic oils is the globe nebulizer, which throws oleaginous solutions
  in the form of a fine fog, that can be deeply inhaled. Menthol,
  eucalyptol and white pine extract are some of the remedies that may be
  tried dissolved in benzoinol, to which cocaine or opium may be added if
  the cough is troublesome.</p>
      <p>When the bronchitis is of the capillary form, the great object is to
  maintain the patient's strength, and to endeavour to secure the expulsion
  of the morbid secretion from the fine bronchi. In addition to the
  remedies already alluded to, stimulants are called for from the first;
  and should the cough be ineffectual in relieving the bronchial tubes, the
  administration of an emetic dose of sulphate of zinc may produce a good
  effect.</p>
      <p>During the whole course of any attack of bronchitis attention must be
  paid to the due nourishment of the patient; and during the subsequent
  convalescence, which, particularly in elderly persons, is apt to be slow,
  tonics and stimulants may have to be prescribed.</p>

         <i>Chronic bronchitis</i> may arise as the result of repeated attacks
  of the acute form, or it may exist altogether independently. It occurs
  more frequently among persons advanced in life than among the young,
  although no age is exempt from it. The usual history of this form of
  bronchitis is that of a cough recurring during the colder seasons of the
  year, and in its earlier stages, departing entirely in summer, so that it
  is frequently called "winter cough." In many persons subject to it,
  however, attacks are apt to be excited at any time by very slight causes,
  such as changes in the weather; and in advanced cases of the disease the
  cough is seldom altogether absent. The symptoms and auscultatory signs of
  chronic bronchitis are on the whole similar to those pertaining to the
  acute form, except that the febrile disturbance and pain are much less
  marked. The cough is usually more troublesome in the morning than during
  the day. There is usually free and copious expectoration, and
  occasionally this is so abundant as to constitute what is termed
  <i>bronchorrhoea</i>.</p>
      <p>Chronic bronchitis leads to alterations of structure in the affected
  bronchial tubes, their mucous membrane becoming thickened or even
  ulcerated, while occasionally permanent dilatation of the bronchi takes
  place, often accompanied with profuse foetid expectoration. In
  long-standing cases of chronic bronchitis the nutrition of the lungs
  becomes impaired, and dilatation of the air-tubes (<i>emphysema</i>) and
  other complications result, giving rise to more or less constant
  breathlessness.</p>
      <p>Chronic bronchitis may arise secondarily to some other ailment. This
  is especially the case in Bright's disease of the kidneys and in heart
  disease, of both of which maladies it often proves a serious
  complication, also in gout and syphilis. The influence of occupation is
  seen in the frequency in which persons following certain employments
  suffer from chronic bronchitis. Hirt has shown that the inhalation of
  vegetable dust is very liable to produce bronchitis through the
  irritation produced by the dust particles and the growth of organisms
  carried in with the dust. Consequently, millers and grain-shovellers are
  especially liable to it, while next in order come weavers and workers in
  cotton factories.</p>
      <p>The treatment to be adopted in chronic bronchitis depends upon the
  severity of the case, the age of the patient and the presence or absence
  of complications. Attention to the general health is a matter of prime
  importance in all cases of the disease, more particularly among persons
  whose avocations entail exposure, and tonics with cod-liver oil will be
  found highly advantageous. The use of a respirator in very cold or damp
  weather is a valuable means of protection. In those aggravated forms of
  chronic bronchitis, where the slightest exposure to cold air brings on
  fresh attacks, it may become necessary, where circumstances permit, to
  enjoin confinement to a warm room or removal to a more genial climate
  during the winter months.</p>
