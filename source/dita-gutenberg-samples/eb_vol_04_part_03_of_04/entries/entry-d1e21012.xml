   <title>BROMLEY, SIR THOMAS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROMLEY, SIR THOMAS--> (1530-1587), English lord chancellor, was
  born in Staffordshire in 1530. He was educated at Oxford University and
  called to the bar at the Middle Temple. Through family influence as well
  as the patronage of Sir Nicholas Bacon, the lord keeper, he quickly made
  progress in his profession. In 1566 he was appointed recorder of London,
  and in 1569 he became solicitor-general. He sat in parliament
  successively for Bridgnorth, Wigan and Guildford. On the death of Sir
  Nicholas Bacon in 1579 he was appointed lord chancellor. As an equity
  judge he showed great and profound knowledge, and his judgment in
  Shelley's case (<i>q.v.</i>) is a landmark in the history of English real
  property law. He presided over the commission which tried Mary, queen of
  Scots, in 1586, but the strain of the trial, coupled with the
  responsibility which her execution involved upon him, proved too much for
  his strength, and he died on the 12th of April 1587. He was buried in
  Westminster Abbey.</p>
