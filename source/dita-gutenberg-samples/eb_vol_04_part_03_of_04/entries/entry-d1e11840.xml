   <body>
      <p><!--BRIERLEY, BENJAMIN--> (1825-1896), English weaver and writer in
  Lancashire dialect, was born near Manchester, the son of humble parents,
  and started life in a textile factory, educating himself in his spare
  time. At about the age of thirty he began to contribute articles to local
  papers, and the republication of some of his sketches of Lancashire
  character in <i>A Summer Day in Daisy Nook</i> (1859) attracted
  attention. In 1863 he definitely took to journalism and literature as his
  work, publishing in 1863 his <i>Chronicles of Waverlow</i>, and in 1864 a
  long story called <i>The Layrock of Langley Side</i> (afterwards
  dramatized), followed by others. He started in 1869 <i>Ben Brierley's
  Journal</i>, a weekly, which continued till 1891, and he gave public
  readings from his own writings, visiting America in 1880 and 1884. His
  various <i>Ab-o'-th'-Yate</i> sketches (about America, London, &amp;c.),
  and his pictures of Lancashire common life were very popular, and were
  collected after his death. In 1884 he lost his savings by the failure of
  a building society, and a fund was raised for his support. He died on the
  18th of January 1896, and two years later a statue was erected to him in
  Queen's Park, Manchester.</p>
