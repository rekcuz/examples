      <p><!--BROWNE, JAMES--> (1703-1841), Scottish man of letters, was born at
  Whitefield, Perthshire, in 1793. He was educated at Edinburgh and at the
  university of St Andrews, where he studied for the church. He wrote a
  "Sketch of the History of Edinburgh," for Ewbank's <i>Picturesque
  Views</i> of that city, 1823-1825. In 1826 he became a member of the
  Faculty of Advocates, and obtained the degree of LL.D. from King's
  College, Aberdeen. His works include a <i>Critical Examination of
  Macculloch's Work on the Highlands and Islands of Scotland</i> (1826),
  <i>Aperçu sur les Hiêroglyphes d'Égypte</i> (Paris, 1827), a
  <i>Vindication of the Scottish Bar from the Attacks of Mr Broughton</i>,
  and <i>History of the Highlands and Highland Clans</i> (1834-1836). He
  was appointed editor of the <i>Caledonian Mercury</i> in 1827; and two
  years later he became sub-editor of the seventh edition of the
  <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, to which he contributed a large number
  of articles. He died in April 1841.</p>
