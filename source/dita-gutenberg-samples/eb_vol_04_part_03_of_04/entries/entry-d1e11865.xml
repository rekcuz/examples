   <body>
      <p><!--BRIEUX, EUGÈNE--> (1858- ), French dramatist, was born in Paris of
  poor parents on the 19th of January 1858. A one-act play, <i>Bernard
  Palissy</i>, written in collaboration with M. Gaston Salandri, was
  produced in 1879, but he had to wait eleven years before he obtained
  another hearing, his <i>Ménage d' artistes</i> being produced by Antoine
  at the Théâtre Libre in 1890. His plays are essentially didactic, being
  aimed at some weakness or iniquity of the social system.
  <i>Blanchette</i> (1892) pointed out the evil results of education of
  girls of the working classes; <i>M. de Réboval</i> (1892) was directed
  against pharisaism; <i>L'Engrenage</i> (1894) against corruption in
  politics; <i>Les Bienssaiteurs</i> (1896) against the frivolity of
  fashionable charity; and <i>L'Évasion</i> (1896) satirized an
  indicriminate belief in the doctrine of heredity. <i>Les Trois Filles de
  M. Dupont</i> (1897) is a powerful, somewhat brutal, study of the
  miseries imposed on poor middle-class girls by the French system of
  dowry; <i>Le Résultat des courses</i> (1898) shows the evil results of
  betting among the Parisian workmen; <i>La Robe rouge</i> (1900) was
  directed against the injustices of the law; <i>Les Remplaçantes</i>
  (1901) against the practice of putting children out to nurse. <i>Les
  Avariés</i> (1901), forbidden by the censor, on account of its medical
  details, was read privately by the author at the Théâtre Antoine; and
  <i>Petite amie</i> (1902) describes the life of a Parisian shop-girl.
  Later plays are <i>La Couvée</i> (1903, acted privately at Rouen in
  1893), <i>Maternité</i> (1904), <i>La Déserteuse</i> (1904), in
  collaboration with M. Jean Sigaux, and <i>Les Hannetons</i>, a comedy in
  three acts (1906).</p>
