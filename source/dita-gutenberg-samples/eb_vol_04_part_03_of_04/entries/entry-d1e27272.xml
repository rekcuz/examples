   <title>BRYN MAWR COLLEGE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRYN MAWR COLLEGE,--> an institution of advanced learning for
  women, at Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., 5 m. W. of Philadelphia. The
  site occupies 52 acres and overlooks a broad expanse of rolling country.
  The buildings are of grey stone in the Jacobean Gothic style, and consist
  of an administration and lecture hall, a science hall, a library
  containing in 1908 about 55,000 volumes mostly for special study, a
  gymnasium, a hospital and six halls of residence. The requirements for
  matriculation are high; students are required to choose their studies
  according to the "group system," which permits them to specialize in two
  or more subjects; and instruction is given largely by means of lectures.
  The college is open to "hearers" who are not required to matriculate, to
  undergraduate matriculated students who are not studying for a degree, to
  undergraduate matriculated students who are candidates for the degree of
  B.A., and to graduate students who are candidates for the degree of M.A.
  or Ph.D. The government rests in a board of thirteen trustees and sixteen
  directors, all the trustees being members of the board of directors. The
  president of the college is a trustee and director. The institution was
  founded by Dr Joseph W. Taylor (1810-1880), a member of the Society of
  Orthodox Friends, and he provided that the trustees also should be
  members, but otherwise Bryn Mawr College is non-sectarian. It was
  incorporated in 1880, and was opened for instruction in 1885. In 1908 it
  had 419 students.</p>
