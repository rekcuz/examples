   <body>
      <p><!--BRÜHL,--> a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province, 8 m.
  S.W. from Cologne on the main railway to Coblenz. Pop. (1900) 5000. Its
  pleasant situation at the foot of one of the spurs of the Eifel range and
  the beautiful grounds surrounding the royal palace render it a favourite
  resort of the inhabitants of Cologne. The palace, in Renaissance style,
  built in 1728 by Clement Augustus, elector of Cologne (1700-1761), was
  from 1809 until 1813 in the possession of the French marshal Davout, and
  in 1842 was restored by King Frederick William IV. of Prussia.</p>
