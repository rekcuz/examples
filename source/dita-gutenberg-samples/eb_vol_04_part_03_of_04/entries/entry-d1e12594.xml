   <body>
      <p><!--BRIONIAN ISLANDS,--> a group of small islands, in the Adriatic
  Sea, off the west coast of Istria, from which they are separated by the
  narrow Canale di Fasana. They belong to Austria and <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page573">[v.04 p.0573]</ph>are
  twelve in number. Up to a recent period they were chiefly noted for their
  quarries, which have been worked for centuries and have supplied material
  not only for the palaces and bridges of Venice and the whole Adriatic
  coast, but latterly for Vienna and Berlin also. As they command the
  entrance to the naval harbour of Pola, a strong fortress, "Fort
  Tegetthoff," has been erected on the largest of them (Brioni), together
  with minor fortifications on some of the others. The islands are
  inhabited by about 100 Italian quarrymen.</p>
