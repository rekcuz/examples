   <title>BRUMMAGEM</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRUMMAGEM--> (an old local form of "Birmingham"), a name first
  applied to a counterfeit coin made in the city of Birmingham, England, in
  the I7th century, and later to the plated and imitation articles made
  there; hence cheap, showy or tawdry. The name was particularly used of
  the supporters of the Exclusion Bill in 1680, with the meaning of "sham
  Protestant." Similarly the Tory opponents of the Bill were nicknamed
  "Anti-Birminghams" or "Brummagems."</p>
