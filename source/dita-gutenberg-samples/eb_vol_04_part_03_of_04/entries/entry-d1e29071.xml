      <p><!--BUCER--> (or <ph outputclass="sc">Butzer</ph>), <b>MARTIN</b>
  (1491-1551), German Protestant reformer, was born in 1491 at Schlettstadt
  in Alsace. In 1506 he entered the Dominican order, and was sent to study
  at Heidelberg. There he became acquainted with the works of Erasmus and
  Luther, and was present at a disputation of the latter with some of the
  Romanist doctors. He became a convert to the reformed opinions, abandoned
  his order by papal dispensation in 1521, and soon afterwards married a
  nun. In 1522 he was pastor at Landstuhl in the palatinate, and travelled
  hither and thither propagating the reformed doctrine. After his
  excommunication in 1523 he made his headquarters at Strassburg, where he
  succeeded Matthew Zell. Henry VIII of England asked his advice in
  connexion with the divorce from Catherine of Aragon. On the question of
  the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, Bucer's opinions were decidedly
  Zwinglian, but he was anxious to maintain church unity with the Lutheran
  party, and constantly endeavoured, especially after Zwingli's death, to
  formulate a statement of belief that would unite Lutheran, south German
  and Swiss reformers. Hence the charge of ambiguity and obscurity which
  has been laid against him. In 1548 he was sent for to Augsburg to sign
  the agreement, called the <i>Interim</i>, between the Catholics and
  Protestants. His stout opposition to this project exposed him to many
  difficulties, and he was glad to accept Cranmer's invitation to make his
  home in England. On his arrival in 1549 he was appointed regius professor
  of divinity at Cambridge. Edward VI. and the protector Somerset showed
  him much favour and he was consulted as to the revision of the Book of
  Common Prayer. But on the 27th of February 1551 he died, and was buried
  in the university church, with great state. In 1557, by Mary's
  commissioners, his body was dug up and burnt, and his tomb demolished; it
  was subsequently reconstructed by order of Elizabeth. Bucer is said to
  have written ninety-six treatises, among them a translation and
  exposition of the Psalms and a work <i>Deregno Christi</i>. His name is
  familiar in English literature from the use made of his doctrines by
  Milton in his divorce treatises.</p>
      <p>A collected edition of his writings has never been published. A volume
  known as the <i>Tomus Anglicanus</i> (Basel, 1577) contains those written
  in England. See J.W. Baum, <i>Capito and Butzer</i> (Strassburg, 1860);
  A. Erichson, <i>Martin Butzer</i> (1891); and the articles in the
  <i>Dict. Nat. Biog.</i> (by A.W. Ward), and in Herzog-Hauck's
  <i>Realencyklopädie</i> (by Paul Grünberg).</p>
