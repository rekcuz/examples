   <title>BULFINCH, CHARLES</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BULFINCH, CHARLES--> (1763-1844), American architect, was born in
  Boston, Massachusetts, on the 8th of August 1763, the son of Thomas
  Bulfinch, a prominent and wealthy physician. He was educated at the
  Boston Latin school and at Harvard, where he graduated in 1781, and after
  several years of travel and study in Europe, settled in 1787 in Boston,
  where he was the first to practise as a professional architect. Among his
  early works were the old Federal Street theatre (1793), the first
  play-house in New England, and the "new" State House (1798). For more
  than twenty-five years he was the most active architect in Boston, and at
  the same time took a leading part in the public life of the city. As
  chairman of the board of selectmen for twenty-one years (1797-1818), an
  important position which made him practically chief magistrate, he
  exerted a strong influence in modernizing Boston, in providing for new
  systems of drainage and street-lighting, in reorganizing the police and
  fire departments, and in straightening and widening the streets. He was
  one of the promoters in 1787 of the voyage of the ship "Columbia," which
  under command of Captain Robert Gray (1755-1806) was the first to carry
  the American flag round the world. In 1818 Bulfinch succeeded B.H.
  Latrobe (1764-1820) as architect of the National Capitol at Washington.
  He completed the unfinished wings and central portion, constructing the
  rotunda from plans of his own after suggestions of his predecessor, and
  designed the new western approach and portico. In 1830 he returned to
  Boston, where he died on the 15th of April 1844. Bulfinch's work was
  marked by sincerity, simplicity, refinement of taste and an entire
  freedom from affectation, and it greatly influenced American architecture
  in the early formative period. His son, Stephen Greenleaf Bulfinch
  (1809-1870), was a well-known Unitarian clergyman and author.</p>
