   <title>BROCK, THOMAS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROCK, THOMAS--> (1847- ), English sculptor, was the chief pupil
  of Foley, and later became influenced by the new romantic movement. His
  group "The Moment of Peril" was followed by "The Genius of Poetry,"
  "Eve," and other ideal works that mark his development. His busts, such
  as those of Lord Leighton and Queen Victoria; his statues, such as "Sir
  Richard Owen" and "Dr Philpott, bishop of Worcester"; his sepulchral
  monuments, such as that to Lord Leighton in St Paul's cathedral, a work
  of singular significance, refinement and beauty; and his memorial statues
  of Queen Victoria, at Hove and elsewhere, are examples of his power as a
  portraitist, sympathetic in feeling, sound and restrained in execution,
  and dignified and decorative in arrangement. The colossal equestrian
  statue of "Edward the Black Prince" was set up in the City Square in
  Leeds in 1901, the year in which the sculptor was awarded the commission
  to execute the vast Imperial Memorial to Queen Victoria in front of
  Buckingham Palace. Brock was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in
  1883 and full member in 1891.</p>
