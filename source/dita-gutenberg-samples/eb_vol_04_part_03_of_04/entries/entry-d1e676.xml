   <title>BREVET</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BREVET--> (a diminutive of the Fr. <i>bref</i>), a short writing,
  originally an official writing or letter, with the particular meaning of
  a papal indulgence. The use of the word is mainly confined to a
  commission, or official document, giving to an officer in the army a
  permanent, as opposed to a local and temporary, rank in the service
  higher than that he holds substantively in his corps. In the British army
  "brevet rank" exists only above the rank of captain, but in the United
  States army it is possible to obtain a brevet as first lieutenant. In
  France the term <i>brevet√©</i> is particularly used with respect to the
  General Staff, to express the equivalent of the English "passed Staff
  College" (p.s.c.).</p>
