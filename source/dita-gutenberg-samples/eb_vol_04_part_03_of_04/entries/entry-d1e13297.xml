   <title>BRISTOL</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRISTOL,--> a borough of Bucks county, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., on
  the Delaware river, opposite Burlington, New Jersey, 20 m. N.E. of
  Philadelphia. Pop. (1890) 6553; (1900) 7104 (1134 foreign-born); (1910)
  9256. It is served by the Pennsylvania railway. The borough is built on
  level ground elevated several feet above the river, and in the midst of
  an attractive farming country. The principal business houses are on Mill
  Street; while Radcliffe Street extends along the river. Among Bristol's
  manufacturing establishments are machine shops, rolling mills, a planing
  mill, yarn, hosiery and worsted mills, and factories for making carpets,
  wall paper and patent leather. Bath Springs are located just outside the
  borough limits; though not so famous as they were early in the 18th
  century, these springs are still well known for the medicinal properties
  of their chalybeate waters. Bristol was one of the first places to be
  settled in Pennsylvania after William Penn received his charter for the
  province in 1681, and from its settlement until 1725 it was the seat of
  government of the county. It was laid out in 1697 and was incorporated as
  a borough in 1720; the present charter, however, dates only from
  1851.</p>
