   <title>BUGIS</title>

      <p><!--BUGIS,--> or <ph outputclass="sc">Bughis</ph>, a people of Malayan
  stock, originally occupying only the kingdom of Boni in the south-western
  peninsula of the island of Celebes. From this district they spread over
  the whole island, and founded settlements throughout the whole Malay
  Archipelago. They are of middle size and robust, of very active,
  enterprising nature and of a complexion slightly lighter than the average
  Malay. In disposition they are brave, haughty and fierce, and are said to
  be more predisposed towards "running amuck" than any other Malayans. They
  speak a language allied to that of the Macassars, and write it with
  similar characters. It has been studied, and its letters reproduced in
  type by Dr B.F. Mathes of the Netherlands Bible Society. The Bugis are
  industrious and ingenious; they practise agriculture more than the
  neighbouring tribes, and manufacture cotton-cloth not only for their own
  use but for export. They also carry on a considerable trade in the
  mineral and vegetable products of Boni, such as gold-dust,
  tortoise-shell, pearls, nut-megs and camphor. Thair love of the sea has
  given them almost a monopoly of trade around Celebes. Their towns <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page760">[v.04
  p.0760]</ph>are well built and they have schools of their own. The king
  is elected generally for life, and always from their own number, by the
  chiefs of the eight petty states that compose the confederation of Boni,
  and he cannot decide on any public measure without their consent. In some
  of the states the office of chief is hereditary; in others any member of
  the privileged classes may aspire to the dignity, and it not infrequently
  happens that the state is governed by a woman. The Bugis have been
  Mahommedans since the 17th century. Their original form of nature-worship
  had been much affected by Hindu influences, and even now they retain
  rites connected with the worship of Siva. See further <ph outputclass="sc">Boni; Celebes</ph>.</p>
