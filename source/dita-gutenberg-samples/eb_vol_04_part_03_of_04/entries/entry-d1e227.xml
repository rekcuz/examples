      <p><!--BRESSUIRE,--> a town of western France, capital of an
  arrondissement in the department of Deux-Sèvres, 48 m. N. of Niort by
  rail. Pop. (1906) 4561. The town is situated on an eminence overlooking
  the Dolo, a tributary of the Argenton. It is the centre of a
  cattle-rearing and agricultural region, and has important markets; the
  manufacture of wooden type and woollen goods is carried on. Bressuire has
  two buildings of interest: the church of Notre-Dame, which, dating
  chiefly from the 12th and 15th centuries, has an imposing tower of the
  Renaissance period; and the castle, built by the lords of <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page500">[v.04
  p.0500]</ph>Beaumont, vassals of the viscount of Thouars. The latter is
  now in ruins, and a portion of the site is occupied by a modern château,
  but an inner and outer line of fortifications are still to be seen. The
  whole forms the finest assemblage of feudal ruins in Poitou. Bressuire is
  the seat of a sub-prefect and has a tribunal of first instance. Among the
  disasters suffered at various times by the town, its capture from the
  English and subsequent pillage by French troops under du Guesclin in 1370
  is the most memorable.</p>
