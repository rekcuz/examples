      <p><!--BUHTURĪ--> [al-Walīd ibn 'Ubaid Allāh]
  (820-897), Arabian poet, was born at Manbij (Hierapolis) in Syria,
  between Aleppo and the Euphrates. Like Abū Tammām, he was of
  the tribe of Tāi. While still young, he went to visit Abū
  Tammām at Horns, and by him was commended to the authorities at
  Ma'arrat un-Nu'mān, who gave him a pension of 4000 dirhems (about
  £90) yearly. Later he went to Bagdad, where he wrote verses in praise of
  the caliph Motawakkil and of the members of his court. Although long
  resident in Bagdad he devoted much of his poetry to the praise of Aleppo,
  and much of his love-poetry is dedicated to Alwa, a maiden of that city.
  He died at Manbij Hierapolis in 897. His poetry was collected and edited
  twice in the 10th century, arranged in one edition alphabetically (i.e.
  according to the last consonant in each line); in the other according to
  subjects. It was published in Constantinople (<ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph> 1883). Like Abū Tammām he made a
  collection of early poems, known as the Hamāsa (index of the poems
  contained in it, in the <i>Journal of the German Oriental Society</i>,
  vol. 47, pp. 418 ff., cf. vol. 45, pp. 470 ff.).</p>
      <p>Biography in M<sup>c</sup>G. de Slane's translation of Ibn
  Khallikān's <i>Biographical Dictionary</i> (Paris and London,
  1842), vol. iii. pp. 657 ff.; and in the <i>Book of Songs</i> (see <ph outputclass="sc">Abulfaraj</ph>), vol. xviii. pp. 167-175.</p>
