   <body>
      <p><!--BUCKLAND, FRANCIS TREVELYAN--> (1826-1880), English zoologist, son
  of Dean William Buckland the geologist, was born at Oxford on the 17th of
  December 1826. He was educated at Winchester and Christ Church, taking
  his degree in 1848, and then adopted the medical profession, studying at
  St George's hospital, London, where he became house-surgeon in 1852. The
  pursuit of anatomy led him to a good deal of out-of-the-way research in
  zoology, and in 1856 he became a regular writer on natural history for
  the newly established <i>Field</i>, particularly on the subject of fish.
  In 1866 he started <i>Land and Water</i> on similar lines. In 1867 he was
  appointed government inspector of fisheries, and in the course of his
  work travelled constantly about the country, being largely responsible
  for the increased attention paid to the scientific side of pisciculture.
  Among his publications, besides articles and official reports, were
  <i>Fish Hatching</i> (1863), <i>Curiosities of Natural History</i> (4
  vols., 1857-1872), <i>Logbook of a Fisherman</i> (1875), <i>Natural
  History of British Fishes</i> (1881). He died on the 19th of December
  1880.</p>
