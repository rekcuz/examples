      <p><!--BUCKETSHOP,--> a slang financial term for the office or business
  of an inferior class of stockbroker, who is not a member of an official
  exchange and conducts speculative operations for his clients, who deposit
  a margin or cover. The operations consist, as a rule, of a simple bet or
  wager between the broker and client, no pretence of an actual purchase or
  sale being attempted. The term is sometimes, though loosely and
  wrongfully, applied to <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page721">[v.04 p.0721]</ph>all stockbrokers who are not
  members of the recognized local exchange. The origin of the word is
  American. According to the <i>New English Dictionary</i> it is supposed
  to have arisen in Chicago. The Board of Trade there forbade dealings in
  "options" in grain of less than 5000 bushels. An "Open Board of Trade" or
  unauthorized exchange was opened, for the purpose of small gamblers, in a
  neighbouring street below the rooms of the Board of Trade. The lift used
  by members of the Board of Trade would be sent down to bring up from the
  open Board what was known as a "bucketful" of the smaller speculators,
  when business was slack.</p>
