   <body>
      <p><!--BREST-LITOVSK--> (Polish <i>Brzesc-Litevski</i>; and in the Chron.
  <i>Berestie</i> and <i>Berestov</i>), a strongly fortified town of
  Russia, in the government of Grodno, 137 m. by rail S. from the city of
  Grodno, in 52° 5′ N. lat. and 23° 39′ E. long., at the
  junction of the navigable river Mukhovets with the Bug, and at the
  intersection of railways from Warsaw, Kiev, Moscow and East Prussia. Pop.
  (1867) 22,493; (1901) 42,812, of whom more than one-half were Jews. It
  contains a Jewish synagogue, which was regarded in the 16th century as
  the first in Europe, and is the seat of an Armenian and of a Greek
  Catholic bishop; the former has authority over the Armenians throughout
  the whole country. The town carries on an extensive trade in grain, flax,
  hemp, wood, tar and leather. First mentioned in the beginning of the 11th
  century, Brest-Litovsk was in 1241 laid waste by the Mongols and was not
  rebuilt till 1275; its suburbs were burned by the Teutonic Knights in
  1379; and in the end of the 15th century the whole town met a similar
  fate at the hands of the khan of the Crimea. In the reign of the Polish
  king Sigismund III. diets were held there; and in 1594 and 1596 it was
  the meeting-place of two remarkable councils of the bishops of western
  Russia. In 1657, and again in 1706, the town was captured by the Swedes;
  in 1794 it was the scene of Suvarov's victory over the Polish general
  Sierakowski; in 1795 it was added to the Russian empire. The
  Brest-Litovsk or King's canal (50 m. long), utilizing the Mukhovets-Bug
  rivers, forms a link in the waterways that connect the Dnieper with the
  Vistula.</p>
