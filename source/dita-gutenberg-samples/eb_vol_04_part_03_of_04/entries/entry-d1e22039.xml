      <p><!--BROOKE, FULKE GREVILLE,--> <ph outputclass="scac">1ST BARON</ph>
  (1554-1628), English poet, only son of Sir Fulke Greville, was born at
  Beauchamp Court, Warwickshire. He was sent in 1564, on the same day as
  his life-long friend, Philip Sidney, to Shrewsbury school. He
  matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1568. Sir Henry Sidney,
  president of Wales, gave him in 1576 a post connected with the court of
  the Marches, but he resigned it in 1577 to go to court with Philip
  Sidney. Young Greville became a great favourite with Queen Elizabeth, who
  treated him with less than her usual caprice, but he was more than once
  disgraced for leaving the country against her wishes. Philip Sidney, Sir
  Edward Dyer and Greville were members of the "Areopagus," the literary
  clique which, under the leadership of Gabriel Harvey, supported the
  introduction of classical metres into English verse. Sidney and Greville
  arranged to sail with Sir Francis Drake in 1585 in his expedition against
  the Spanish West Indies, but Elizabeth peremptorily forbade Drake to take
  them with him, and also refused Greville's request to be allowed to join
  Leicester's army in the Netherlands. Philip Sidney, who took part in the
  campaign, was killed on the 17th of October 1586, and Greville shared
  with Dyer the legacy of his books, while in his <i>Life of the Renowned
  Sir Philip Sidney</i> he raised an enduring monument to his friend's
  memory. About 1591 Greville served for a short time in Normandy under
  Henry of Navarre. This was his last experience of war. In 1583 he became
  secretary to the principality of Wales, and he represented Warwickshire
  in parliament in 1592-1593, 1597, 1601 and 1620. In 1598 he was made
  treasurer of the navy, and he retained the office through the early years
  of the reign of James I. In 1614 he became chancellor and under-treasurer
  of the exchequer, and throughout the reign he was a valued supporter of
  the king's party, although in 1615 he advocated the summoning of a
  parliament. In 1618 he became commissioner of the treasury, and in 1621
  he was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron Brooke, a title
  which had belonged to the family of his paternal grandmother, Elizabeth
  Willoughby. He received from James I. the grant of Warwick Castle, in the
  restoration of which he is said to have spent £20,000. He died on the
  30th of September 1628 in consequence of a wound inflicted by a servant
  who was disappointed at not being named in his master's will. Brooke was
  buried in St Mary's church, Warwick, and on his tomb was inscribed the
  epitaph he had composed for himself: "Folk Grevill Servant to Queene
  Elizabeth Conceller to King James Frend to Sir Philip Sidney. Trophaeum
  Peccati."</p>
      <p>A rhyming elegy on Brooke, published in Huth's <i>Inedited Poetical
  Miscellanies</i>, brings charges of extreme penuriousness against him,
  but of his generous treatment of contemporary writers there is abundant
  testimony. His only works published during his lifetime were four poems,
  one of which is the elegy on Sidney which appeared in <i>The Phoenix
  Nest</i> (1593), and the <i>Tragedy of Mustapha</i>. A volume of his
  works appeared in 1633, another of <i>Remains</i> in 1670, and his
  biography of Sidney in 1652. He wrote two tragedies on the Senecan model,
  <i>Alaham</i> and <i>Mustapha</i>. The scene of Alaham is laid in Ormuz.
  The development of the piece fully bears out the gloom of the prologue,
  in which the ghost of a former king of Ormuz reveals the magnitude of the
  curse about to descend on the doomed family. The theme of <i>Mustapha</i>
  is borrowed from Madeleine de Scudéry's <i>Ibrahim ou l'illustre
  Bassa</i>, and turns on the ambition of the sultana Rossa. The choruses
  of these plays are really philosophical dissertations, and the connexion
  with the rest of the drama is often very slight. In <i>Mustapha</i>, for
  instance, the third chorus is a dialogue between Time and Eternity, while
  the fifth consists of an invective against the evils of superstition,
  followed by a chorus of priests that does nothing to dispel <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page644">[v.04 p.0644]</ph>the
  impression of scepticism contained in the first part. He tells us himself
  that the tragedies were not intended for the stage. Charles Lamb says
  they should rather be called political treatises. Of Brooke Lamb says,
  "He is nine parts Machiavel and Tacitus, for one of Sophocles and
  Seneca.... Whether we look into his plays or his most passionate
  love-poems, we shall find all frozen and made rigid with intellect." He
  goes on to speak of the obscurity of expression that runs through all
  Brooke's poetry, an obscurity which is, however, due more to the
  intensity and subtlety of the thought than to any lack of mere verbal
  lucidity.</p>
      <p>It is by his biography of Sidney that Fulke Greville is best known.
  The full title expresses the scope of the work. It runs: <i>The Life of
  the Renowned Sr. Philip Sidney. With the true Interest of England as it
  then stood in relation to all Forrain Princes: And particularly for
  suppressing the power of Spain Stated by Him: His principall Actions,
  Counsels, Designes, and Death. Together with a short account of the
  Maximes and Policies used by Queen Elizabeth in her Government</i>. He
  includes some autobiographical matter in what amounts to a treatise on
  government. He had intended to write a history of England under the
  Tudors, but Robert Cecil refused him access to the necessary state
  papers.</p>
      <p>Brooke left no sons, and his barony passed to his cousin, Robert
  Greville (<i>c.</i> 1608-1643), who thus became 2nd Lord Brooke. This
  nobleman was imprisoned by Charles I. at York in 1639 for refusing to
  take the oath to fight for the king, and soon became an active member of
  the parliamentary party; taking part in the Civil War he defeated the
  Royalists in a skirmish at Kineton in August 1642. He was soon given a
  command in the midland counties, and having seized Lichfield he was
  killed there on the 2nd of March 1643. Brooke, who is eulogized as a
  friend of toleration by Milton, wrote on philosophical, theological and
  current political topics. In 1746 his descendant, Francis Greville, the
  8th baron (1710-1773), was created earl of Warwick, a title still in his
  family.</p>
      <p>Dr A.B. Grosart edited the complete works of Fulke Greville for the
  <i>Fuller Worthies Library</i> in 1870, and made a small selection,
  published in the <i>Elizabethan Library</i> (1894). Besides the works
  above mentioned, the volumes include <i>Poems of Monarchy, A Treatise of
  Religion, A Treatie of Humane Learning, An Inquisition upon Fame and
  Honour, A Treatie of Warres, Caelica in CX Sonnets</i>, a collection of
  lyrics in various forms, a letter to an "Honourable Lady," a letter to
  Grevill Varney in France, and a short speech delivered on behalf of
  Francis Bacon, some minor poems, and an introduction including some of
  the author's letters. The life of Sidney was reprinted by Sir S. Egerton
  Brydges in 1816; and with an introduction by N. Smith in the "Tudor and
  Stuart Library" in 1907; <i>Caelica</i> was reprinted in M.F. Crow's
  "Elizabethan Sonnet Cycles" in 1898. See also an essay in Mrs. C.C.
  Stopes's <i>Shakespeare's Warwickshire Contemporaries</i> (1907).</p>
