   <title>BRUMAIRE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRUMAIRE,--> the name of the second month in the republican
  calendar which was established in France by a decree of the National
  Convention on the 5th of October in the year II. (1793), completed with
  regard to nomenclature by Fabre d'Églantine, and promulgated in its new
  form on the 4th of Frimaire in the year II. (the 24th of November 1793).
  The month of Brumaire began on the day which corresponded, according to
  the year, to the 22nd or to the 23rd of October of the old calendar, and
  ended on the 20th or 21st of November, It was divided into "decades" like
  the other months of the republican calendar. Its name alludes to the fogs
  and mists frequent at that time of the year. The most important event in
  French history which took place during that month was the <i>coup
  d'état</i> of the 18th Brumaire in the year VIII. (the 9th of November
  1799), by which General Bonaparte overthrew the government of the
  Directory to replace it by the Consulate.</p>

  républicain," in <i>La Révolution française</i> for 1884-1885.</p>
