      <p><!--BRUT-->, <ph outputclass="sc">Brute</ph>, or <ph outputclass="sc">Brutus
  the Trojan</ph>, a legendary British character, who, according to
  Geoffrey of Monmouth and others, <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page695">[v.04 p.0695]</ph>was the
  eponymous hero of Britain. He was reputed to be grandson of Aeneas, and
  the legend was that he was banished from Italy and made his way to
  Britain, where he founded New Troy (London). The name is an obvious
  confusion between Bryt (a Briton) and the classical name Brutus.</p>
