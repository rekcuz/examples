   <title>BRITON-FERRY</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRITON-FERRY,--> a seaport in the mid-parliamentary division of
  Glamorganshire, Wales, on the eastern bank of the estuary of the Neath
  river in Swansea Bay, with stations on the Great Western and the Rhondda
  &amp; Swansea Bay railways, being 174 m. by rail from London. Pop. of
  urban district (1901) 6973. A tram-line connects it with Neath, 2 m.
  distant, and the Vale of Neath Canal (made in 1797) has its terminus
  here. The district was formerly celebrated for its scenery, but this has
  been considerably marred by industrial development which received its
  chief impetus from the construction in 1861 of a dock of 13 acres, the
  property of the Great Western Railway Company, and the opening up about
  the same time of the mining districts of Glyncorrwg and Maesteg by means
  of the South Wales mineral railway, which connects them with the dock and
  supplies it with its chief export, coal. Steel and tinplates are
  manufactured here on a large scale. There are also iron-works and a
  foundry.</p>
      <p>The name La Brittone was given by the Norman settlers of the 12th
  century to its ferry across the estuary of the Neath (where Archbishop
  Baldwin and Giraldus crossed in 1188, and which is still used), but the
  Welsh name of the town from at least the 16th century has been
  Llansawel.</p>
