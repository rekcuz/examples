      <p><!--BRUNO,--> or <ph outputclass="sc">Brun</ph> (925-965), archbishop of
  Cologne, third son of the German king, Henry I., the Fowler, by his
  second wife Matilda, was educated for the church at Utrecht, where he
  <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page686">[v.04
  p.0686]</ph>distinguished himself by his studious zeal. In 940 his
  brother, King Otto, afterwards the emperor Otto the Great, appointed him
  chancellor, and some years later arch-chaplain, and under his leadership
  the chancery was reformed and became a training ground for capable
  administrators. He rendered valuable assistance to his brother Otto in
  his efforts to suppress the risings which marked the earlier part of his
  reign, services which were rewarded in 953 when Bruno was made archbishop
  of Cologne, and about the same time duke of Lorraine. Bruno is chiefly
  renowned as a scholar and a patron of learning. He consorted eagerly with
  learned foreigners, tried to secure a better education for the clergy,
  and was mainly instrumental in making his brother's court a centre of
  intellectual life. He built many churches, and, aided by the tendency of
  the time, sought to purify monastic life. He died at Reims on the 11th of
  October 965, and was buried in the church of St Pantaleon at Cologne.</p>
