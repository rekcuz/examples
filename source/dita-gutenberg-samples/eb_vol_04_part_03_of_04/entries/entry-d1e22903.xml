      <p><!--BROUGH, ROBERT--> (1872-1905), British painter, was born at
  Invergordon, Ross-shire. He was educated at Aberdeen, and, whilst
  apprenticed for over six years as lithographer to Messrs Gibb &amp; Co.,
  attended the night classes at the local art school. He then entered the
  Royal Scottish Academy, and in the first year took the Stuart prize for
  figure painting, the Chalmers painting bursary, and the Maclaine-Walters
  medal for composition. After two years in Paris under J.P. Laurens and
  Benjamin-Constant at Julian's <i>atelier</i>, he settled in Aberdeen in
  1894 as a portrait painter and political cartoonist. A portrait of Mr
  W.D. Ross first drew attention to his talent in 1896, and in the
  following year he scored a marked success at the Royal Academy with his
  "Fantaisie en Folie," now at the National Gallery of British Art (Tate
  Gallery). Two of his paintings, "'Twixt Sun and Moon" and "Childhood of
  St Anne of Brittany," are at the Venice municipal gallery. Brough's art
  is influenced by Raeburn and by modern French training, but it strikes a
  very personal note. Robert Brough met his death from injuries received in
  a railway disaster in 1905, his early death being a notable loss to
  British art.</p>
