   <title>BULANDSHAHR</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BULANDSHAHR,--> a town and district of British India in the Meerut
  division of the United Provinces. The town is situated on a height on the
  right bank of the Kali-Nadi, whence the substitution of the names
  Unchanagar and Bulandshahr (high town) for its earlier name of Baran, by
  which it is still sometimes called. The population in 1901 was 18,959.
  Its present handsome appearance is due to several successive collectors,
  notably F.S. Growse, who was active in erecting public buildings, and in
  encouraging the local gentry to beautify their own houses. In particular,
  it boasts a fine bathing-ghat, a town-hall, a market-place, a tank to
  supply water, and a public garden.</p>
      <p>The <ph outputclass="sc">District of Bulandshahr</ph> has an area of
  1899 sq. m. The district stretches out in a level plain, with a gentle
  slope from N.W. to S.E., and a gradual but very slight elevation about
  midway between the Ganges and Jumna. Principal rivers are the Ganges and
  Jumnaâ€”the former navigable all the year round, the latter only
  during the rains. The Ganges canal intersects the district, and serves
  both for irrigation and navigation. The Lower Ganges canal has its
  headworks at Narora. The climate of the district is liable to extremes,
  being very cold in the winter and excessively hot in the summer. In 1901
  the population was 1,138,101, showing an increase of 20% in the decade.
  The district is very highly cultivated and thickly populated. There are
  several indigo factories, and mills for pressing and cleaning cotton, but
  the former have greatly suffered by the decline in indigo of recent
  years. The main line of the East Indian railway and the Oudh and
  Rohilkhand railway cross the district. The chief centre of trade is
  Khurja.</p>
      <p>Nothing certain is known of the history of the district before <ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph> 1018, when Mahmud of Ghazni appeared before
  Baran and received the submission of the Hindu raja and his followers to
  Islam. In 1193 the city was captured by Kutb-ud-din. In the 14th century
  the district was subject to invasions of Rajput and Mongol clans who left
  permanent settlements in the country. With the firm establishment of the
  Mogul empire peace was restored, the most permanent effect of this period
  being the large proportion of Mussulmans among the population, due to the
  zeal of Aurangzeb. The decline of the Mogul empire gave free play to the
  turbulent spirit of the Jats and Gujars, many of whose chieftains
  succeeded in carving out petty principalities for themselves at the
  expense of their neighbours. During this period, however, Baran had
  properly no separate history, being a dependency of Koil, whence it
  continued to be administered under the Mahratta domination. After Koil
  and the fort of Aligarh had been captured by the British in 1803,
  Bulandshahr and the surrounding country were at first incorporated in the
  newly created district of Aligarh (1805). Bulandshahr enjoyed an evil
  reputation in the Mutiny of 1857, when the Gujar peasantry plundered the
  towns. The Jats took the side of the government, while the Gujars and
  Mussulman Rajputs were most actively hostile.</p>
