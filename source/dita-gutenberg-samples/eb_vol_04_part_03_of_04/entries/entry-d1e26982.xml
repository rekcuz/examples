      <p><!--BRY, THEODORUS--> [<ph outputclass="sc">Dirk</ph>] <b>DE</b>
  (1528-1598), German engraver and publisher, was born at Li√©ge in 1528. In
  the earlier years of his career he worked at Strassburg. Later he
  established an engraving and publishing business at Frankfort-On-Main,
  and also visited London in or before 1587. Here he became acquainted with
  the geographer Richard Hakluyt, with whose assistance he collected
  materials for a finely illustrated collection of voyages and travels,
  <i>Collectiones Peregrinationum in Indiam Orientalem et Indiam
  Occidentalem</i> (25 parts, 1590-1634). Among other works he engraved a
  set of 12 plates illustrating the Procession of the Knights of the Garter
  in 1576, and a set of 34 plates illustrating the Procession at the
  Obsequies of Sir Philip Sidney; plates for T. Hariot's <i>Briefe and True
  Report of the new found Land of Virginia</i> (Frankfort, 1595); the
  plates for the first four volumes of J.J. Boissard's <i>Romanae Urbis
  Topographia et Antiquitates</i> (1597-1598), and a series of portraits
  entitled <i>Icones Virorum Illustrium</i> (1597-1599). De Bry died at
  Frankfort on the 27th of March 1598. He had been assisted by his eldest
  son Johannes Theodorus de Bry (1561-1623), who after his father's death
  carried on the <i>Collectiones</i> and the illustration of Boissard's
  work, and also added to the <i>Icones.</i> His brother Johannes Israel de
  Bry (d. 1611) collaborated with him.</p>
