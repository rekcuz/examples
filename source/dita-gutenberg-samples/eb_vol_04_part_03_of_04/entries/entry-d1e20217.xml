   <body>
      <p><!--BRÖGGER, WALDEMAR CHRISTOFER--> (1851- ), Norwegian geologist, was
  born in Christiania on the 10th of November 1851, and educated in that
  city. In 1876 he was appointed curator of the geological museum in his
  native city, and assistant on the Geological Survey. He was professor of
  mineralogy and geology from 1881 to 1890 in the university of Stockholm,
  and from 1890 in the university of Christiania. He also became rector and
  president of the senate of the royal university of Christiania. His
  observations on the igneous rocks of south Tirol compared with those of
  Christiania afford much information on the relations of the granitic and
  basic rocks. The subject of the differentiation of rock-types in the
  process of solidification as plutonic or volcanic rocks from a particular
  magma received much attention from him. He dealt also with the Palaeozoic
  rocks of Norway, and with the late glacial and post-glacial changes of
  level in the Christiania region. The honorary degree of Ph.D. was
  conferred upon him by the university of Heidelberg and that of LL.D. by
  the university of Glasgow. The Murchison medal of the Geological Society
  of London was awarded to him in 1891.</p>
