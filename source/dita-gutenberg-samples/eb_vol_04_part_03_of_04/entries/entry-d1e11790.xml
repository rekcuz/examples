   <title>BRIELLE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIELLE--> (<i>Briel</i> or <i>Bril</i>), a seaport in the
  province of South Holland, Holland, on the north side of the island of
  Voorne, at the mouth of the New Maas, 5Â½ m. N. of Hellevoetsluis. Pop.
  (1900) 4107. It is a fortified place and has a good harbour, arsenal,
  magazine and barracks. It also possesses a quaint town hall, and an
  orphanage dating from 1533. The tower of the Groote Kerk of St Catherine
  serves as a lighthouse. Most of the trade of Brielle was diverted to
  Hellevoetsluis by the cutting of the Voornsche Canal in 1829, but it
  still has some business in corn and fodder, as well as a few factories. A
  large number of the inhabitants are also engaged in the fisheries and as
  pilots.</p>
      <p>The chief event in the history of Brielle is its capture by the
  <i>Gueux sur Mer</i>, a squadron of privateers which raided the Dutch
  coast under commission of the prince of Orange. This event, which took
  place on the 1st of April 1572, was the first blow in the long war of
  Dutch independence, and was followed by a general outbreak of the
  patriotic party (Motley, <i>Rise of the Dutch Republic</i>, part iii.
  chapter vi.). "The Brill" was one of the four Dutch towns handed over to
  Queen Elizabeth in 1584 as security for English expenses incurred in
  aiding the Dutch. Brielle is the birthplace of the famous admiral Martin
  van Tromp, and also of Admiral van Almonde, a distinguished commander of
  the early 18th century.</p>
