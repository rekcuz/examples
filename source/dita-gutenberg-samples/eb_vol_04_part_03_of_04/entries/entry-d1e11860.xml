      <p><!--BRIERLY, SIR OSWALD WALTERS--> (1817-1894), English marine
  painter, who came of an old Cheshire family, was born at Chester. He
  entered Sass's art-school in London, and after studying naval
  architecture at Plymouth he exhibited some drawings of ships at the Royal
  Academy in 1839. He had a passion for the sea, and in 1841 started round
  the world with Benjamin Boyd (1796-1851), afterwards well known as a
  great Australian squatter, in the latter's ship "Wanderer," and having
  got to New South Wales, made his home at Auckland for ten years. Brierly
  Point is called after him. He added to his sea experiences by voyages on
  H.M.S. "Rattlesnake" in 1848, and with Sir Henry Keppel on the "Meander"
  in 1850; he returned to England in 1851 on this ship, and illustrated
  Keppel's book about his cruise (1853). He was again with Keppel during
  the Crimean War, and published in 1855 a series of lithographs
  illustrating "The English and French fleets in the Baltic." He was now
  taken up by Queen Victoria and other members of the royal family, and was
  attached to the suites of the duke of Edinburgh and the prince of Wales
  on their tours by sea, the results being seen in further marine pictures
  by him; and in 1874 he was made marine-painter to the queen. He exhibited
  at the Academy, but more largely at the Royal Water-colour Society, his
  more important works including the historical pictures, "The Retreat of
  the Spanish Armada" (1871) and "The Loss of the Revenge" (1877). In 1885
  he was knighted, and he died on the 14th of December 1894. He was twice
  married and had an active and prosperous life, but was no great artist;
  his best pictures are at Melbourne and Sydney.</p>
