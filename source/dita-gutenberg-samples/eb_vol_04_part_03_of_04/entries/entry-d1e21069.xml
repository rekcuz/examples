      <p><!--BROMSGROVE-->, a market town in the Eastern parliamentary division
  of Worcestershire, England, 12 m. N.N.E. of Worcester, with a station 1
  m. from the town on the Bristol-Birmingham line of the Midland railway.
  Pop. of urban district (1901) 8418. It lies in a pleasant undulating
  district near the foot of the Lickey Hills, to surmount which the railway
  towards Birmingham here ascends for 2 m. one of the steepest gradients in
  England over such a distance. There remain several picturesque
  half-timbered houses, dating from 1572 and later. The church of St John
  is a fine building, Perpendicular and earlier in date, picturesquely
  placed on an elevation above the town, with a lofty tower and spire.
  There are a well-known grammar-school, founded by Edward VI., with
  university scholarships; a college school, a literary institute, and a
  school of art. Birmingham Sanatorium stands in the parish. Cloth was
  formerly a staple of trade, but manufactures of nails and buttons are now
  pre-eminent, while the river Salwarpe works a number of mills in the
  neighbourhood, and near the town are carriage works belonging to the
  Midland railway.</p>
