   <title>BUGTI</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUGTI,--> a Baluch tribe of Rind (Arab) origin, numbering about
  15,500, who occupy the hills to the east of the Sind-Peshin railway,
  between Jacobabad and Sibi, with the Marris (a cognate tribe) to the
  north of them. Like the Marris, the Bugtis are physically a magnificent
  race of people, fine horsemen, good swordsmen and hereditary robbers. An
  expedition against them was organized by Sir C. Napier in 1845, but they
  were never brought under control till Sir Robert Sandeman ruled
  Baluchistan. Since the construction of the railway, which completely
  outflanks their country, they have been fairly orderly.</p>
