      <p><!--BRITOMARTIS--> ("sweet maiden"), an old Cretan goddess, later
  identified with Artemis. According to Callimachus (<i>Hymn to Diana</i>,
  190), she was a nymph, the daughter of Zeus and Carme, and a favourite
  companion of Artemis. Being pursued by Minos, king of Crete, who was
  enamoured of her, she sprang from a rock into the sea, but was saved from
  drowning by falling into some fishermen's nets. She was afterwards made a
  goddess by Artemis under the name of Dictynna (<ph outputclass="grk">δίκτυον</ph>, "a <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page617">[v.04
  p.0617]</ph>net"). She was the patroness of hunters, fishermen and
  sailors, and also a goddess of birth and health. The centre of her
  worship was Cydonia, whence it extended to Sparta and Aegina (where she
  was known as Aphaea) and the islands of the Mediterranean. By some she is
  considered to have been a moon-goddess, her flight from Minos and her
  leap into the sea signifying the revolution and disappearance of the moon
  (Pausanias ii. 30, iii. 14; Antoninus Liberalis 40).</p>
