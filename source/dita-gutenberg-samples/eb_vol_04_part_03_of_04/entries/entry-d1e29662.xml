   <title>BUCHER, LOTHAR</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCHER, LOTHAR--> (1817-1892), German publicist, was born on the
  25th of October 1817 at Neu Stettin, in Pomerania, his father being
  master at a gymnasium. After studying at the university of Berlin he
  adopted the legal profession. Elected a member of the National Assembly
  in Berlin in 1848, he was an active leader of the extreme democratic
  party. With others of his colleagues he was in 1850 brought to trial for
  having taken part in organizing a movement for refusal to pay taxes; he
  was condemned to fifteen months' imprisonment in a fortress, but left the
  country before the sentence was executed. For ten years he lived in
  exile, chiefly in London; he acted as special correspondent of the
  <i>National Zeitung</i>, and gained a great knowledge of English life;
  and he published a work, <i>Der Parliamentarismus wie er ist</i>, a
  criticism of parliamentary government, which shows a marked change in his
  political opinions. In 1860 he returned to Germany, and became intimate
  with Lassalle, who made him his literary executor. In 1864 he was offered
  by Bismarck, and accepted, a high position in the Prussian foreign
  office. The reasons that led him to a step which involved so complete a
  break with his earlier friends and associations are not clearly known.
  From this time till his death he acted as Bismarck's secretary, and was
  the man who probably enjoyed the greatest <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page719">[v.04 p.0719]</ph>amount of his
  confidence. It was he who drew up the text of the constitution of the
  North German Confederation; in 1870 he was sent on a very confidential
  mission to Spain in connexion with the Hohenzollern candidature for the
  Spanish crown; he assisted Bismarck at the final negotiations for the
  treaty of Frankfort, and was one of the secretaries to the congress of
  Berlin; he also assisted Bismarck in the composition of his memoirs.
  Bucher, who was a man of great ability, had considerable influence, which
  was especially directed against the economic doctrines of the Liberals;
  in 1881 he published a pamphlet criticizing the influence and principles
  of the Cobden Club. He identified himself completely with Bismarck's
  later commercial and colonial policy, and probably had much to do with
  introducing it, and he did much to encourage anti-British feeling in
  Germany. He died at Glion, in Switzerland, on the 12th of October
  1892.</p>
