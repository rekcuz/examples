   <title>BUCK</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCK,--> (1) (From the O. Eng. <i>buc</i>, a he-goat, and
  <i>bucca</i>, a male deer), the male of several animals, of goats, hares
  and rabbits, and particularly of the fallow-deer. During the 18th century
  the word was used of a spirited, reckless young man of fashion, and
  later, with particular reference to extravagance in dress, of a dandy.
  (2) (From a root common to Teutonic and Romance languages, cf. the Ger.
  <i>Bauch</i>, Fr. <i>buée</i>, and Ital. <i>bucata</i>), the bleaching of
  clothes in lye, also the lye itself, and the clothes to be bleached, so a
  "buck-basket" means a basket of clothes ready for the wash. (3) Either
  from an obsolete word meaning "body," or from the sense of bouncing or
  jumping, derived from (1), a word now only found in compound words, as
  "buck-board," a light four-wheeled vehicle, the primitive form of which
  has one or more seats on a springy board, joining the front and rear
  axles and serving both as springs and body; a "buck-wagon" (Dutch,
  <i>bok-wagen</i>) is a South African cart with a frame projecting over
  the wheels, used for the transport of heavy loads. (4) (Either from
  "buck" a he-goat, or from a common Teutonic root, to bend, as seen in the
  Ger. <i>bücken</i>, and Eng. "bow"), a verb meaning "to leap"; seen
  especially in the compound "buck-jumper," a horse which leaps clear off
  the ground, with feet tucked together and arched back, descending with
  fore-feet rigid and head down and drawn inwards.</p>
