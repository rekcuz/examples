      <p><!--BROWN, JOHN GEORGE--> (1831- ), American painter, was born in
  Durham, England, on the 11th of November 1831. He studied at
  Newcastle-on-Tyne, in the Edinburgh Academy, and after removing to New
  York City in 1853, at the schools of the National Academy of Design of
  which he afterwards became a member. In 1866 he became one of the charter
  members of the Water-Colour Society, of which he was president from 1887
  to 1904. He generally confined himself to representations of street child
  life, bootblacks, newsboys, &amp;c. ; his "Passing Show" (Paris, Salon,
  1877) and "Street Boys at Play" (Paris Exhibition, 1900) are good
  examples of his popular talent.</p>
