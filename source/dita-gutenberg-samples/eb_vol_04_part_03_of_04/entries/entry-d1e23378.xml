      <p><!--BROWN, JACOB--> (1775-1828), American soldier, was born of Quaker
  ancestry, in Bucks county, Pennsylvania, on the 9th of May 1775. From
  1796 to 1798 he was engaged in surveying public lands in Ohio; in 1798 he
  settled in New York City, and during the period (1798-1800) when war with
  France seemed imminent he acted as military secretary to Alexander
  Hamilton, then inspector-general of the United States army. Subsequently
  he purchased a large tract of land in Jefferson county, New York, where
  he founded the town of Brownville. There he served as county judge, and
  attained the rank (1810) of brigadier-general in the state militia. On
  the outbreak of the second war with Great Britain (1812) he was placed in
  command of the New York state frontier from Oswego to Lake St Francis
  (near Cornwall, Ontario) and repelled the British attacks on Ogdensburg
  (October 4, 1812) and Sackett's Harbor (May 29, 1813). In July 1813 he
  was commissioned brigadier-general in the regular army, and in January
  1814 he was promoted major-general and succeeded General James Wilkinson
  in command of the forces at Niagara. Early in the summer of 1814 he
  undertook offensive operations, and his forces occupied Fort Erie, and,
  on the 5th of July, at Chippawa, Ontario, defeated the British under
  General Phineas Riall (c. 1769-1851). On the 25th of July, with General
  Winfield Scott, he fought a hotly contested, but indecisive, battle with
  the British under General Gordon Drummond (1771-1854) at Lundy's Lane,
  where he was twice wounded. After the war he remained in the army, of
  which he was the commanding general from March 1821 until his death at
  Washington, D.C., on the 24th of February 1828.</p>
