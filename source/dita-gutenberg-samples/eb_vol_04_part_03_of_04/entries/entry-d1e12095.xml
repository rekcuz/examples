   <title>BRIGANTES</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIGANTES--> (Celtic for "mountaineers" or "free, privileged"), a
  people of northern Britain, who inhabited the country from the mouth of
  the Abus (Humber) on the east and the Belisama (Mersey; according to
  others, Ribble) on the west as far northwards as the Wall of Antoninus.
  Their territory thus included most of Yorkshire, the whole of Lancashire,
  Durham, Westmorland, Cumberland and part of Northumberland. Their chief
  town was Eburacum (or Eboracum; York). They first came into contact with
  the Romans during the reign of Claudius, when they were defeated by
  Publius Ostorius Scapula. Under Vespasian they submitted to Petillius
  Cerealis, but were not finally subdued till the time of Antoninus Pius
  (Tac. <i>Agricola</i>, 17; Pausan. viii. 43. 4). The name of their
  eponymous goddess Brigantia is found on inscriptions (<i>Corp. Inscr.
  Lat.</i> vii. 200, 875, 1062; F. Haverfield in <i>Archaeological
  Journal</i>, xlix., 1892), and also that of a god Bergans = Brigans
  (<i>Ephemeris Epigraphica</i>, vii. No. 920). A branch of the Brigantes
  also settled in the south-east corner of Ireland, near the river Birgus
  (Barrow).</p>
