      <p><!--BREWER, JOHN SHERREN--> (1810-1879), English historian, was born
  in Norwich in 1810, the son of a Baptist schoolmaster. He was educated at
  Queen's College, Oxford, was ordained in the Church of England in 1837,
  and became chaplain to a central London workhouse. In 1839 he was
  appointed lecturer in classical literature at King's College, London, and
  in 1855 he became professor of English language and literature and
  lecturer in modern history, succeeding F.D. Maurice. Meanwhile from 1854
  onwards he was also engaged in journalistic work on the <i>Morning
  Herald</i>, <i>Morning Post</i> and <i>Standard</i>. In 1856 he was
  commissioned by the master of the rolls to prepare a calendar of the
  state papers of Henry VIII., a work demanding a vast amount of research.
  He was also made reader at the Rolls, and subsequently preacher. In 1877
  Disraeli secured for him the crown living of Toppesfield, Essex. There he
  had time to continue his task of preparing his <i>Letters and Papers of
  the Reign of King Henry VIII</i>., the Introductions to which (published
  separately, under the title <i>The Reign of Henry VIII</i>., in 1884)
  form a scholarly and authoritative history of Henry VIII.'s reign. New
  editions of several standard historical works were also produced under
  Brewer's direction. He died at Toppesfield in February 1879.</p>
