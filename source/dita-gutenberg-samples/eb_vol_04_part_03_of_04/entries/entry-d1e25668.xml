      <p><!--BRUNET, JACQUES CHARLES--> (1780-1867), French bibliographer, was
  born in Paris on the 2nd of November 1780. He was the son of a
  bookseller, and in 1802 he printed a supplement to the <i>Dictionnaire
  bibiographique de livres rares</i> (1790) of Duclos and Cailleau. In 1810
  there appeared the first edition of his <i>Manuel du libraire et de
  l'amateur des livres</i> (3 vols.). Brunet published successive editions
  of his great bibliographical dictionary, which rapidly came to be
  recognized as the first book of its class in European literature. He died
  on the 14th of November 1867. Among his other works are <i>Nouvelles
  Recherches bibliographiques</i> (1834), <i>Recherches ... sur les
  Ã©ditions originales ... de Rabelais</i> (1852), and an edition of the
  French poems of J.G. Alione d'Asti, dating from the beginning of the 16th
  century (1836).</p>
      <p>See also a notice by Le Roux de Lincy, prefixed to the catalogue
  (1868) of his own valuable library. A supplement to the 5th edition
  (1860-1865) of the <i>Manuel du libraire</i> was published (1878-1880) by
  P. Deschamps and G. Brunet.</p>
