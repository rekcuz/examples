   <title>BUKOVINA</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUKOVINA,--> a duchy and crownland of Austria, bounded E. by
  Russia and Rumania, S. by Rumania, W. by Transylvania and Hungary, and N.
  by Galicia. Area, 4035 sq. m. The country, especially in its southern
  parts, is occupied by the offshoots of the Carpathians, which attain in
  the Giumaleu an altitude of 6100 ft. The principal passes are the Radna
  Pass and the Borgo Pass. With the exception of the Dniester, which skirts
  its northern border, Bukovina belongs to the watershed of the Danube. The
  principal rivers are the Pruth, and the Sereth with its affluents the
  Suczawa, the Moldava and the Bistritza. The climate of Bukovina is
  healthy but severe, especially in winter; but it is generally milder than
  that of Galicia, the mean annual temperature at Czernowitz being 46.9Â° F.
  No less than 43.17% of the total area is occupied by woodland, and the
  very name of the country is derived from the abundance of beech trees. Of
  the remainder 27.59% is occupied by arable land, 12.68% by meadows,
  10.09% by pastures and 0.78% by gardens. The soil of Bukovina is fertile,
  and agriculture has made great progress, the principal products being
  wheat, maize, rye, oats, barley, potatoes, flax and hemp. Cattle-rearing
  constitutes another important source of revenue. The principal mineral is
  salt, which is extracted at the mine of Kaczyka, belonging to the
  government. Brewing, distilling and milling are the chief industries.
  Commerce is mostly in the hands of the Jews and Armenians, and chiefly
  confined to raw products, such as agricultural produce, cattle, wool and
  wood. Bukovina had in 1900 a population of 729,921, which is equivalent
  to 181 inhabitants per sq. m. According to nationality, over 40% were
  Ruthenians, 35% Rumanians, 13% Jews, and the remainder was composed of
  Germans, Poles, Hungarians, Russians and Armenians. The official language
  of the administration, of the law-courts, and of instruction in the
  university is German. Nearly 70% of the population belong to the Greek
  Orthodox Church, and stand under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the
  archbishop or metropolitan of Czernowitz. To the Roman Catholic Church
  belong 11%, to the Greek United Church 3.25%, while 2.5% are Protestants.
  Elementary education is improving, but, after Dalmatia, Bukovina still
  shows the largest number of illiterates in Austria. The local diet, of
  which the archbishop of Czernowitz and the rector of the university are
  members <i>ex officio</i>, is composed of 31 members, and Bukovina sends
  14 deputies to the Reichsrat at Vienna. For administrative purposes, the
  country is divided into 9 districts and an autonomous municipality,
  Czernowitz (pop. 69,619), the capital. Other towns are Radautz (14,343),
  Suczawa (10,946), Kuczurmare (9417), Kimpolung (8024) and Sereth
  (7610).</p>
      <p>Bukovina was originally a part of the principality of Moldavia, whose
  ancient capital Suczawa was situated in this province. It was occupied by
  the Russians in 1769, and by the Austrians in 1774. In 1777 the Porte,
  under whose suzerainty Moldavia was, ceded this province to Austria. It
  was incorporated with Galicia in a single province in 1786, but was
  separated from it in 1849, and made a separate crownland.</p>
