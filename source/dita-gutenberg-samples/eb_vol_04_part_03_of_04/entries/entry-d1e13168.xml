   <title>BRISTOL</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRISTOL,--> a city, county of a city, municipal, county and
  parliamentary borough, and seaport of England, chiefly in Gloucestershire
  but partly in Somersetshire, 118½ m. W. of London. Pop. (1901) 328,945.
  The Avon, here forming the boundary between Gloucestershire and Somerset,
  though entering the estuary of the Severn (Bristol Channel) only 8 m.
  below the city, is here confined between considerable hills, with a
  narrow valley-floor on which the nucleus of the city rests. Between
  Bristol and the Channel the valley becomes a gorge, crossed at a single
  stride by the famous Clifton Suspension Bridge. Above Bristol the hills
  again close in at Keynsham, so that the city lies in a basin-like hollow
  some 4 m. in diameter, and extends up the heights to the north. The Great
  Western railway, striking into the Avon valley near Bath, serves Bristol
  from London, connects it with South Wales by the Severn tunnel, and with
  the southern and south-western counties of England. Local lines of this
  company encircle the city on the north and the south, serving the
  outports of Avonmouth and Portishead on the Bristol Channel. A trunk line
  of the Midland railway connects Bristol with the north of England by way
  of Gloucester, Worcester, Birmingham and Derby. Both companies use the
  central station, Temple Meads.</p>
      <p>The nucleus of Bristol lies to the north of the river. The business
  centre is in the district traversed by Broad Street, High Street, Wine
  Street and Corn Street, which radiate from a centre close to the Floating
  Harbour. To the south of this centre, connected with it by Bristol
  Bridge, an island is formed between the Floating Harbour and the New
  Course of the Avon, and here are Temple Meads station, above Victoria
  Street, two of the finest churches (the Temple and St Mary Redcliffe) the
  general hospital and other public buildings. Immediately above the bridge
  the little river Frome joins the Avon. Owing to the nature of the site
  the streets are irregular; in the inner part of the city they are
  generally narrow, and sometimes, with their ancient gabled houses,
  extremely picturesque. The principal suburbs surround the city to the
  west, north and east.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Churches, &amp;c.</i>—In the centre of Bristol a remarkable
  collection of architectural antiquities is found, principally
  ecclesiastical. This the city owes mainly to a few great baronial
  families, such as the earls of Gloucester and the Berkeleys, in its early
  history, and to a few great merchants, the Canyngs, Shipwards and
  Framptons, in its later career. The see of Bristol, founded by Henry
  VIII. in 1542, was united to that of Gloucester in 1836; but again
  separated in 1896. The diocese includes parts of Gloucestershire and
  Wiltshire, and a small but populous <ph outputclass="sidenote">Cathedral.</ph> portion of Somerset. The cathedral,
  standing above the so-called Canons' Marsh which borders the Floating
  Harbour, is pleasantly situated on the south side of College Green. It
  has two western towers and a central tower, nave, short transepts, choir
  with aisles, an eastern Lady chapel and other chapels; and on the south,
  a chapter-house and cloister court. The nave is modern (by Street, 1877),
  imitating the choir of the 14th century, with its curious
  skeleton-vaulting in the aisles. Besides the canopied tombs of the
  Berkeleys with their effigies in chain mail, and similarly fine tombs of
  the crosiered abbots, there are memorials to Bishop Butler, to Sterne's
  Eliza (Elizabeth Draper), and to Lady Hesketh (the friend of Cowper), who
  are all interred here. There is also here William Mason's fine epitaph to
  his wife (d. 1767), beginning "Take, holy earth, all that my soul holds
  dear." Of Fitz-Harding's abbey of St Augustine, founded in 1142 (of which
  the present cathedral was the church), the stately entrance gateway, with
  its sculptured mouldings, remains hardly injured. The abbot's gateway,
  the vestibule to the chapter-house, and the chapter-house itself, which
  is carved with Byzantine exuberance of decoration, and acknowledged to be
  one of the finest Norman chambers in Europe, are also perfect. On the
  north side of College Green is the small but ornate Mayor's chapel
  (originally St Mark's), devoted to the services of the mayor and
  corporation. It is mainly Decorated and Perpendicular. Of the churches
  within the centre of the city, the following are found within a radius of
  half-a-mile from Bristol Bridge. St Stephen's church, built between 1450
  and 1490, is a dignified structure, chiefly interesting for its
  fan-traceried porch and stately tower. It was built entirely by the
  munificence of John Shipward, a wealthy merchant. The tower and spire of
  St John's (15th century) stand on one of the gateways of the city. This
  church is a parallelogram, without east or west windows or aisles, and is
  built upon a fine groined crypt. St James's church, the burial place of
  its founder, Robert, earl of Gloucester, dates from 1130, and fine Norman
  work remains in the nave. The tower is of the 14th century. St Philip's
  has an Early English tower, but its external walls and windows are for
  the most part debased Perpendicular. Robert FitzHamon's Norman tower of
  St Peter, the oldest church tower in Bristol, still presents its massive
  square to the eye. This church stands in Castle Street, which
  commemorates the castle of Robert, earl of Gloucester, the walls of which
  were 25 ft. thick at the base. Nothing remains of this foundation, but
  there still exist some walls and vaults of the later stronghold,
  including a fine Early English cell. Adjacent to the church is St Peter's
  hospital, a picturesque gabled building of Jacobean and earlier date,
  with a fine court room. St Mary le Port and St Augustine the Less are
  churches of the Perpendicular era, and not the richest specimens of their
  kind. St Nicholas church is modern, on a crypt of the date 1503, and
  earlier. On the island south of the Floating Harbour are two of the most
  interesting churches in the city. Temple church, with its leaning tower,
  5 ft. off the perpendicular, retains nothing of the Templars' period, but
  is a fine building of the Decorated and Perpendicular periods. The church
  of <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page580">[v.04
  p.0580]</ph>St Mary Redcliffe, for grandeur of proportion and
  elaboration of design and finish, is the first ecclesiastical building in
  Bristol, and takes high rank among the parish churches of England. It was
  built for the most part in the latter part of the 14th century by William
  Canyng or Canynges (<i>q.v.</i>), but the sculptured north porch is
  externally Decorated, and internally Early English. The fine tower is
  also Decorated, on an Early English base. The spire, Decorated in style,
  is modern. Among numerous monuments is that of Admiral Penn (d. 1718),
  the father of the founder of Pennsylvania. The church exhibits the rare
  feature of transeptal aisles. Of St Thomas's, in the vicinity, only the
  tower (15th century) remains of the old structures. All Hallows church
  has a modern Italian campanile, but is in the main of the 15th century,
  with the retention of four Norman piers in the nave; and is interesting
  from its connexion with the ancient gild of calendars, whose office it
  was "to convert Jews, instruct youths," and keep the archives of the
  town. Theirs was the first free library in the city, possibly in England.
  The records of the church contain a singularly picturesque representation
  of the ancient customs of the fraternity.</p>
      <p>Among conventual remains, besides those already mentioned, there exist
  of the Dominican priory the Early English refectory and dormitory, the
  latter comprising a row of fifteen original windows and an oak roof of
  the same date; and of St Bartholomew's hospital there is a double arch,
  with intervening arcades, also Early English. These, with the small
  chapel of the Three Kings of Cologne, Holy Trinity Hospital, both
  Perpendicular, and the remains of the house of the Augustinian canons
  attached to the cathedral, comprise the whole of the monastic relics.</p>
      <p>There are many good specimens of ancient domestic
  architecture—notably some arches of a grand Norman hall and some
  Tudor windows of Colston's house, Small Street; and Canyng's house, with
  good Perpendicular oak roof. Of buildings to which historic interest
  attaches, there are the Merchant Venturers' almshouses (1699), adjoining
  their hall. This gild was established in the 16th century. A small house
  near St Mary Redcliffe was the school where the poet Chatterton received
  his education. His memorial is in the churchyard of St Mary, and in the
  church a chest contains the records among which he claimed to have
  discovered some of the manuscripts which were in reality his own. A house
  in Wine Street was the birthplace of the poet-laureate Robert Southey
  (1744).</p>
      <p>
         <i>Public Buildings, &amp;c.</i>—The public buildings are
  somewhat overshadowed in interest by the ecclesiastical. The council
  house, at the "Cross" of the four main thoroughfares, dates from 1827,
  was enlarged in 1894, and contains the city archives and many portraits,
  including a Van Dyck and a Kneller. The Guildhall is close by—a
  modern Gothic building. The exchange (used as a corn-market) is a
  noteworthy building by the famous architect of Bath, John Wood (1743).
  Edward Colston, a revered citizen and benefactor of the city (d. 1721),
  is commemorated by name in several buildings and institutions, notably in
  Colston Hall, which is used for concerts and meetings. A bank close by St
  Stephen's church claims to have originated in the first savings-bank
  established in England (1812). Similarly, the city free library (1613) is
  considered to be the original of its kind. The Bristol museum and
  reference library were transferred to the corporation in 1893. Vincent
  Stuckey Lean (d. 1899) bequeathed to the corporation of Bristol the sum
  of £50,000 for the further development of the free libraries of the city,
  and with especial regard to the formation and sustenance of a general
  reference library of a standard and scientific character. The central
  library was opened in 1906. An art gallery, presented by Sir William
  Henry Wills, was opened in 1905.</p>
      <p>Among educational establishments, the technical college of the Company
  of Merchant Venturers (1885) supplies scientific, technical and
  commercial education. The extensive buildings of this institution were
  destroyed by fire in 1906. University College (1876) forms the nucleus of
  the university of Bristol (chartered 1909). Clifton College, opened in
  1862 and incorporated in 1877, includes a physical science school, with
  laboratories, a museum and observatory. Colston's girls' day school
  (1891) includes domestic economy and calisthenics. Among the many
  charitable institutions are the general hospital, opened in 1858, and
  since repeatedly enlarged; royal hospital for sick children and women,
  Royal Victoria home, and the Queen Victoria jubilee convalescent
  home.</p>
      <p>Of the open spaces in and near Bristol the most extensive are those
  bordering the river in the neighbourhood of the gorge, Durdham and
  Clifton Downs, on the Gloucestershire side (see <ph outputclass="sc">Clifton</ph>). Others are Victoria Park, south of the river,
  near the Bedminster station, Eastville Park by the Frome, on the
  north-east of the city beyond Stapleton Road station, St Andrew's Park
  near Montpelier station to the north, and Brandon Hill, west of the
  cathedral, an abrupt eminence commanding a fine view over the city, and
  crowned with a modern tower commemorating the "fourth centenary of the
  discovery of America by John Cabot, and sons Lewis, Sebastian and
  Sanctus." Other memorials in the city are the High Cross on College Green
  (1850), and statues of Queen Victoria (1888), Samuel Morley (1888),
  Edmund Burke (1894), and Edward Colston (1895), in whose memory are held
  annual Colston banquets.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Harbour and Trade.</i>—Bristol harbour was formed in 1809 by
  the conversion of the Avon and a branch of the Frome into "the Float," by
  the cutting of a new channel for the Avon and the formation of two
  basins. Altogether the water area, at fixed level, is about 85 acres.
  Four dry docks open into the floating harbour. In 1884 the Avonmouth and
  Portishead docks at the river entrance were bought up by the city; and
  the port extends from Hanham Mills on the Avon to the mouth of the river,
  and for some distance down the estuary of the Severn. The city docks have
  a depth of 22 ft., while those at Avonmouth are accessible to the largest
  vessels. In 1902 the construction of the extensive Royal Edward dock at
  Avonmouth was put in hand by the corporation, and the dock was opened by
  King Edward VII. in 1908. It is entered by a lock 875 ft. long and 100
  ft. wide, with a depth of water on the sill of 46 ft. at ordinary spring,
  and 36 ft. at ordinary neap tides. The dock itself has a mean length of
  1120 ft. and a breadth of 1000 ft., and there is a branch and passage
  connecting with the old dock. The water area is about 30 acres, and the
  dock is so constructed as to be easily capable of extension. Portishead
  dock, on the Somerset shore, has an area of 12 acres. The port has a
  large trade with America, the West Indies and elsewhere, the principal
  imports being grain, fruit, oils, ore, timber, hides, cattle and general
  merchandise; while the exports include machinery, manufactured oils,
  cotton goods, tin and salt. The Elder Dempster, Dominion and other large
  steamship companies trade at the port.</p>
      <p>The principal industries are shipbuilding, ropewalks, chocolate
  factories, sugar refineries, tobacco mills and pipe-making, glass works,
  potteries, soaperies, shoe factories, leather works and tanneries,
  chemical works, saw mills, breweries, copper, lead and shot works, iron
  works, machine works, stained-paper works, anchors, chain cables,
  sail-cloth, buttons. A coalfield extending 16 m. south-east to Radstock
  avails much for Bristol manufactures.</p>
      <p>The parliamentary borough is divided into four divisions, each
  returning one member. The government of the city is in the hands of a
  lord mayor, 22 aldermen and 66 councillors. The area in 1901 was 11,705
  acres; but in 1904 it was increased to 17,004 acres.</p>
      <p>
         <i>History.</i>—Bristol (Brigstow, Bristou, Bristow, Bristole)
  is one of the best examples of a town that has owed its greatness
  entirely to trade. It was never a shire town or the site of a great
  religious house, and it owed little to its position as the head of a
  feudal lordship, or as a military post. Though it is near both British
  and Roman camps, there is no evidence of a British or Roman settlement.
  It was the western limit of the Saxon invasion of Britain, and about the
  year 1000 a Saxon settlement began to grow up at the junction of the
  rivers Frome and Avon, the natural advantages of the situation favouring
  the growth of the township. Bristol owed much to Danish rule, and during
  the reign of Canute, when the wool trade with <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page581">[v.04 p.0581]</ph>Ireland began,
  it became the market for English slaves. In the reign of Edward the
  Confessor the town was included in the earldom of Sweyn Godwinsson, and
  at the date of the Domesday survey it was already a royal borough
  governed by a reeve appointed by the king as overlord, the king's geld
  being assessed at 110 marks. There was a mint at the time of the
  Conquest, which proves that Bristol must have been already a place of
  some size, though the fact that the town was a member of the royal manor
  of Baston shows that its importance was still of recent growth. One-third
  of the geld was paid to Geoffrey de Coutances, bishop of Exeter, who
  threw up the earthworks of the castle. He joined in a rebellion against
  William II., and after his death the king granted the town and castle, as
  part of the honour of Gloucester, to Robert FitzHamon, whose daughter
  Mabel, marrying Earl Robert of Gloucester in 1119, brought him Bristol as
  her dowry. Earl Robert still further strengthened the castle, probably
  with masonry, and involved Bristol in the rebellion against Stephen. From
  the castle he harried the whole neighbourhood, threatened Bath, and sold
  his prisoners as slaves to Ireland. A contemporary chronicler describes
  Bristol castle as "seated on a mighty mound, and garrisoned with knights
  and foot soldiers or rather robbers and raiders," and he calls Bristol
  the stepmother of England.</p>
      <p>The history of the charters granted to Bristol begins about this time.
  A charter granted by Henry II. in 1172 exempted the burgesses of Bristol
  from certain tolls throughout the kingdom, and confirmed existing
  liberties. Another charter of the same year granted the city of Dublin to
  the men of Bristol as a colony with the same liberties as their own
  town.</p>
      <p>As a result probably of the close connexion between Bristol and
  Ireland the growth of the wool trade was maintained. Many Bristol men
  settled in Dublin, which for a long time was a Bristol beyond the seas,
  its charters being almost duplicates of those granted to Bristol. About
  this time Bristol began to export wool to the Baltic, and had developed a
  wine trade with the south of France, while soap-making and tanning were
  flourishing industries. Bristol was still organized manorially rather
  than municipally. Its chief courts were the weekly hundred court and the
  court leet held three times a year, and presided over by the reeve
  appointed by the earl of Gloucester. By the marriage of Earl John with
  the heiress of Earl William of Gloucester, Bristol became part of the
  royal demesne, the rent payable to the king being fixed, and the town
  shook off the feudal yoke. The charter granted by John in 1190 was an
  epoch in the history of the borough. It provided that no burgess should
  be impleaded without the walls, that no non-burgess should sell wine,
  cloth, wool, leather or corn in Bristol, that all should hold by burgage
  tenure, that corn need not be ground at the lord's mill, and that the
  burgesses should have all their reasonable gilds. At some uncertain date
  soon after this a commune was established in Bristol on the French model,
  Robert FitzNichol, the first mayor of Bristol, taking the oath in 1200.
  The mayor was chosen, not, like the reeve whom he had displaced, by the
  overlord, but by the merchants of Bristol who were members of the
  merchant gild. The first documentary evidence of the existence of the
  merchant gild appears in 1242. In addition, there were many craft gilds
  (later at least twenty-six were known to exist), the most important being
  the gilds of the weavers, tuckers and fullers, and the Gild of the
  Kalendars of Bristol, which devoted itself to religious, educational and
  social work. The mayor of Bristol was helped by two assistants, who were
  called provosts until 1267, and from 1267 to 1311 were known as stewards,
  and after that date as bailiffs. Before this time many religious houses
  had been founded. Earl Robert of Gloucester established the Benedictine
  priory of St James; there were Dominican and Franciscan priories, a
  monastery of Carmelites, and an abbey of St Augustine founded by Robert
  FitzHardinge.</p>
      <p>In the reign of John, Bristol began the struggle to absorb the
  neighbouring manor of Bedminster, the eastern half of which was held by
  the Templars by gift of Earl Robert of Gloucester, and the western half,
  known as Redcliffe, was sold by the same earl to Robert FitzHardinge,
  afterwards Lord Berkeley. The Templars acquiesced without much
  difficulty, but the wealthy owners of the manor of Redcliffe, who had
  their own manorial courts, market, fair and quay, resisted the union for
  nearly one hundred years. In 1247 a new course was cut for the river
  Frome which vastly improved the harbour, and in the same year a stone
  bridge was built over the Avon, bringing Temple and Redcliffe into closer
  touch with the city. The charter granted by Henry III. in 1256 was
  important. It gave the burgesses the right to choose coroners, and as
  they already farmed the geld payable to the king, Bristol must have been
  practically independent of the king. The growing exclusiveness of the
  merchant gild led to the great insurrection of 1312. The oligarchical
  party was supported by the Berkeleys, but the opposition continued their
  rebellion until 1313, when the town was besieged and taken by the royal
  forces. During the reign of Edward III. cloth manufacture developed in
  Bristol. Thomas Blanket set up looms in 1337, employing many foreign
  workmen, and in 1353 Bristol was made one of the Staple towns, the office
  of mayor of the staple being held by the mayor of the town.</p>
      <p>The charter of 1373 extended the boundaries of the town to include
  Redcliffe (thus settling the long-standing dispute) and the waters of the
  Avon and Severn up to the Steep and Flat Holmes; and made Bristol a
  county in itself, independent of the county courts, with an elected
  sheriff, and a council of forty to be chosen by the mayor and sheriff.
  The town was divided into five wards, each represented by an alderman,
  the aldermen alone being eligible for the mayoralty. This charter
  (confirmed in 1377 and 1488) was followed by the period of Bristol's
  greatest prosperity, the era of William Canyng, of the foundation of the
  Society of Merchant Venturers, and of the voyages of John and Sebastian
  Cabot. William Canyng (1399-1474) was five times mayor and twice
  represented Bristol in parliament; he carried on a huge cloth trade with
  the Baltic and rebuilt St Mary Redcliffe. At the same time cloth was
  exported by Bristol merchants to France, Spain and the Levant. The
  records of the Society of Merchant Venturers began in 1467, and the
  society increased in influence so rapidly that in 1500 it directed all
  the foreign trade of the city and had a lease of the port dues. It was
  incorporated in 1552, and received other charters in 1638 and 1662. Henry
  VII. granted Bristol a charter in 1499 (confirmed in 1510) which removed
  the theoretically popular basis of the corporation by the provision that
  the aldermen were to be elected by the mayor and council. At the
  dissolution of the monasteries the diocese of Bristol was founded, which
  included the counties of Bristol and Dorset. The voyages of discovery in
  which Bristol had played a conspicuous part led to a further trade
  development. In the 16th century Bristol traded with Spain, the Canaries
  and the Spanish colonies in America, shared in the attempt to colonize
  Newfoundland, and began the trade in African slaves which flourished
  during the 17th century. Bristol took a great share in the Civil War and
  was three times besieged. Charles II. granted a formal charter of
  incorporation in 1664, the governing body being the mayor, 12 aldermen,
  30 common councilmen, 2 sheriffs, 2 coroners, a town clerk, clerk of the
  peace and 39 minor officials, the governing body itself filling up all
  vacancies in its number. In the 18th century the cloth trade declined
  owing to the competition of Ireland and to the general migration of
  manufactures to the northern coalfields, but the prosperity of the city
  was maintained by the introduction of manufactures of iron, brass, tin
  and copper, and by the flourishing West Indian trade, sugar being taken
  in exchange for African slaves.</p>
      <p>The hot wells became fashionable in the reign of Anne (who granted a
  charter in 1710), and a little later Bristol was the centre of the
  Methodist revival of Whitefield and Wesley. The city was small, densely
  populated and dirty, with dark, narrow streets, and the mob gained an
  unenviable notoriety for violence in the riots of 1708, 1753, 1767 and
  1831. At the beginning of the 19th century it was obvious that the
  prosperity of Bristol was diminishing, comparatively if not actually,
  owing to (1) the rise of Liverpool, which had more natural facilities as
  a port than Bristol could offer, (2) the abolition of the slave trade,
  <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page582">[v.04
  p.0582]</ph>which ruined the West Indian sugar trade, and (3) the
  extortionate rates levied by the Bristol Dock Company, incorporated in
  1803. These rates made competition with Liverpool and London impossible,
  while other tolls were levied by the Merchant Venturers and the
  corporation. The decline was checked by the efforts of the Bristol
  chamber of commerce (founded in 1823) and by the Municipal Reform Act of
  1835. The new corporation, consisting of 48 councillors and 16 aldermen
  who elected the mayor, being themselves chosen by the burgesses of each
  ward, bought the docks in 1848 and reduced the fees. In 1877-1880 the
  docks at the mouth of the river at Avonmouth and Portishead were made,
  and these were bought by the corporation in 1884. A revival of trade,
  rapid increase of population and enlargement of the boundaries of the
  city followed. The chief magistrate became a lord mayor in 1899.</p>
