   <title>BREWING</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BREWING,--> in the modern acceptation of the term, a series of
  operations the object of which is to prepare an alcoholic beverage of a
  certain kind—to wit, beer—mainly from cereals (chiefly malted
  barley), hops and water. Although the art of preparing beer (<i>q.v.</i>)
  or ale is a very ancient one, there is very little information in the
  literature of the subject as to the apparatus and methods employed in
  early times. It seems fairly certain, however, that up to the 18th
  century these were of the most primitive kind. With regard to
  <i>materials</i>, we know that prior to the general introduction of the
  hop (see <ph outputclass="sc">Ale</ph>) as a preservative and astringent, a
  number of other bitter and aromatic plants had been employed with this
  end in view. Thus J.L. Baker (<i>The Brewing Industry</i>) points out
  that the Cimbri used the <i>Tamarix germanica</i>, the Scandinavians the
  fruit of the sweet gale (<i>Myrica gale</i>), the Cauchi the fruit and
  the twigs of the chaste tree (<i>Vitex agrius castus</i>), and the
  Icelanders the yarrow (<i>
            <ph outputclass="correction">Achillea</ph> millefolium</i>).</p>
      <p>The preparation of beer on anything approaching to a manufacturing
  scale appears, until about the 12th or 13th century, to have been carried
  on in England chiefly in the monasteries; but as the brewers of London
  combined to form an association in the reign of Henry IV., and were
  granted a charter in 1445, it is evident that brewing as a special trade
  or industry must have developed with some rapidity. After the Reformation
  the ranks of the trade brewers were swelled by numbers of monks from the
  expropriated monasteries. Until the 18th century the professional
  brewers, or brewers for sale, as they are now called, brewed chiefly for
  the masses, the wealthier classes preparing their own beer, but it then
  became gradually apparent to the latter (owing no doubt to improved
  methods of brewing, and for others reasons) that it was more economical
  and less troublesome to have their beer brewed for them at a regular
  brewery. The usual charge was 30s. per barrel for bitter ale, and 8s. or
  so for small beer. This tendency to centralize brewing operations became
  more and more marked with each succeeding decade. Thus during 1895-1905
  the number of private brewers declined from 17,041 to 9930. Of the
  private brewers still existing, about four-fifths were in the class
  exempted from beer duty, <i>i.e.</i> farmers occupying houses not
  exceeding £10 annual value who brew for their labourers, and other
  persons occupying houses not exceeding £15 annual value. The private
  houses subject to both beer and licence duty produced less than 20,000
  barrels annually. There are no official figures as to the number of
  "cottage brewers," that is, occupiers of dwellings not exceeding £8
  annual value; but taking everything into consideration it is probable
  that more than 99% of the beer produced in the United Kingdom is brewed
  by public brewers (brewers for sale). The disappearance of the smaller
  public brewers or their absorption by the larger concerns has gone
  hand-in-hand with the gradual extinction of the private brewer. In the
  year 1894-1895 8863 licences were issued to brewers for sale, and by
  1904-1905 this number had been reduced to 5164. There are numerous
  reasons for these changes in the constitution of the brewing industry,
  chief among them being (<i>a</i>) the increasing difficulty, owing partly
  to <ph outputclass="correction">licensing</ph> legislation and its administration, and partly to the
  competition of the great breweries, of obtaining an adequate outlet for
  retail sale in the shape of licensed houses; and (<i>b</i>) the fact that
  brewing has continuously become a more scientific and specialized
  industry, requiring costly and complicated plant and expert manipulation.
  It is only by employing the most up-to-date machinery and expert
  knowledge that the modern brewer can hope to produce good beer in the
  short time which competition and high taxation, &amp;c., have forced upon
  him. Under these conditions the small brewer tends to extinction, and the
  public are ultimately the gainers. The relatively non-alcoholic, lightly
  hopped and bright modern beers, which the small brewer has not the means
  of producing, are a great advance on the muddy, highly hopped and
  alcoholized beverages to which our ancestors were accustomed.</p>
      <p>The brewing trade has reached vast proportions in the United Kingdom.
  The maximum production was 37,090,986 barrels in 1900, and while there
  has been a steady decline since that year, the figures for
  1905-1906—34,109,263 barrels—were in excess of those for any
  year preceding 1897. It is interesting in this connexion to note that the
  writer of the article on Brewing in the 9th edition of the
  <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> was of the opinion that the brewing
  industry—which was then (1875) producing, roughly, 25,000,000
  barrels—had attained its maximum development. In the year ending
  30th September 1905 the beer duty received by the exchequer amounted to
  £13,156,053. The number of brewers for sale was 5180. Of these one firm,
  namely, Messrs Guinness, owning the largest brewery in the world, brewed
  upwards of two million barrels, paying a sum of, roughly, one million
  sterling to the revenue. Three other firms brewed close on a million
  barrels or upwards. The quantity of malt used was 51,818,697 bushels; of
  unmalted corn, 125,671 bushels; of rice, flaked maize and similar
  materials, 1,348,558 cwt.; of sugar, 2,746,615 cwt.; of hops, 62,360,817
  lb; and of hop substitutes, 49,202 lb. The average specific gravity of
  the beer produced in 1905-1906 was 1053.24. The quantity of beer exported
  was 520,826; of beer imported, 57,194 barrels. It is curious to note that
  the figures for exports and imports had remained almost stationary for
  the last thirty years. By far the greater part of the beer brewed is
  consumed in England. Thus of the total quantity retained for consumption
  in 1905-1906, 28,590,563 barrels were consumed in England, 1,648,463 in
  Scotland, and 3,265,084 in Ireland. In 1871 it was calculated by
  Professor Leone Levi that the capital invested in the liquor trade in the
  United Kingdom was £117,000,000. In 1908 this figure might be safely
  doubled. A writer in the <i>Brewers' Almanack</i> for 1906 placed the
  capital invested in limited liability breweries alone at £185,000,000. If
  we allow for over-capitalization, it seems fairly safe to say that, prior
  to the introduction of the Licensing Bill of 1908, the market value of
  the breweries in the United Kingdom, together with their licensed
  property, was in the neighbourhood of £120,000,000, to which might be
  added another £20,000,000 for the value of licences not included in the
  above calculation; the total capital actually sunk in the whole liquor
  trade (including the wine and spirit industries and trades) being
  probably not far short of £250,000,000, and the number of persons
  directly engaged in or dependent on the liquor trade being
  under-estimated at 2,000,000. (For comparative production and consumption
  see <ph outputclass="sc">Beer</ph>.)</p>

         <i>Taxation and Regulations</i>.—The development of the brewing
  industry in England is intimately interwoven with the history of its
  taxation, and the regulations which have from time to time been formed
  for the safeguarding of the revenue. The first duty on beer in the United
  Kingdom was imposed in the reign of Charles II. (1660), namely 2s. 6d.
  per barrel on strong and 6d. per barrel on weak beer. This was gradually
  increased, amounting to 4s. 9d. on strong and 1s. 3d. on weak beer in the
  last decade of the 17th century, and to 8s. to 10s. in the year 1800, at
  which rate it continued until the repeal of the beer duty in 1830. A duty
  on malt was first imposed in the reign of William III. (1697), and from
  that date until 1830 both beer duty and malt tax were charged. The rate
  at first was under 7d. per bushel, but this was increased up to 2s. 7d.
  prior to the first repeal of the beer duty (1830), and to 4s. 6d. after
  the repeal. In 1829 the joint beer and malt taxes amounted to no less
  than 13s. 8d. per barrel, or 4½d. per gallon, as against 2½d. at the
  present day. From 1856 until the abolition of the malt tax, the latter
  remained constant at a fraction under 2s. 8½d. A <i>hop duty</i> varying
  from 1d. to 2½d. per pound was in existence between 1711 and 1862. One of
  the main reasons for the abolition of the hop duty was the fact that,
  owing to the uncertainty of the crop, the amount paid to the revenue was
  subject to wide fluctuations. Thus in 1855 the revenue from this source
  amounted to £728,183, in 1861 to only £149,700.</p>
      <p>It was not until 1847 that the use of sugar in brewing was permitted,
  and in 1850 the first sugar tax, amounting to 1s. 4d. per cwt., was
  imposed. It varied from this figure up to 6s. 6d. in 1854, and in 1874,
  when the general duty on sugar was repealed, it was raised to 11s. 6d.,
  at which rate it remained until 1880, when it was repealed simultaneously
  with the malt duty. In 1901 a general sugar tax of 4s. 2d. and under
  (according to the percentage of actual sugar contained) was imposed, but
  no drawback was allowed to brewers using sugar, and therefore—and
  this obtains at the present day—sugar used in brewing pays the
  general tax and also the beer duty.</p>
      <p>By the Free Mash-Tun Act of 1880, the duty was taken off the malt and
  placed on the beer, or, more properly speaking, on the wort; maltsters'
  and brewers' licences were repealed, and in lieu thereof an annual
  licence duty of £1 payable by every brewer for sale was <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page507">[v.04
  p.0507]</ph>imposed. The chief feature of this act was that, on and
  after the 1st of October 1880, a beer duty was imposed in lieu of the old
  malt tax, at the rate of 6s. 3d. per barrel of 36 gallons, at a specific
  gravity of 1.057, and the regulations for charging the duty were so
  framed as to leave the brewer practically unrestricted as to the
  description of malt or corn and sugar, or other description of saccharine
  substitutes (other than deleterious articles or drugs), which he might
  use in the manufacture or colouring of beer. This freedom in the choice
  of materials has continued down to the present time, except that the use
  of "saccharin" (a product derived from coal-tar) was prohibited in 1888,
  the reason being that this substance gives an apparent palate-fulness to
  beer equal to roughly 4° in excess of its real gravity, the revenue
  suffering thereby. In 1889 the duty on beer was increased by a reduction
  in the standard of gravity from 1.057 to 1.055, and in 1894 a further 6d.
  per barrel was added. The duty thus became 6s. 9d. per barrel, at a
  gravity of 1.055, which was further increased to 7s. 9d. per barrel by
  the war budget of 1900, at which figure it stood in 1909. (See also <ph outputclass="sc">Liquor Laws</ph>.)</p>
      <p>Prior to 1896, rice, flaked maize (see below), and other similar
  preparations had been classed as malt or corn in reference to their
  wort-producing powers, but after that date they were deemed sugar<xref href="#d1e1056/Footnote_041" type="fn"><!--[1]--></xref> in that
  regard. By the new act (1880) 42 lb weight of corn, or 28 lb weight of
  sugar, were to be deemed the equivalent of a bushel of malt, and a brewer
  was expected by one of the modes of charge to have brewed at least a
  barrel (36 gallons) of worts (less 4% allowed for wastage) at the
  standard gravity for every two bushels of malt (or its equivalents) used
  by him in brewing; but where, owing to lack of skill or inferior
  machinery, a brewer cannot obtain the standard quantity of wort from the
  standard equivalent of material, the charge is made not on the wort, but
  directly on the material. By the new act, licences at the annual duty of
  £1 on brewers for sale, and of 6s. (subsequently modified by 44 Vict. c.
  12, and 48 and 49 Vict. c. 5, &amp;c., to 4s.) or 9s., as the case might
  be, on any other brewers, were required. The regulations dealing with the
  mashing operations are very stringent. Twenty-four hours at least before
  mashing the brewer must enter in his brewing book (provided by the Inland
  Revenue) the day and hour for commencing to mash malt, corn, &amp;c., or
  to dissolve sugar; and the date of making such entry; and also, two hours
  at least before the notice hour for mashing, the quantity of malt, corn,
  &amp;c., and sugar to be used, and the day and hour when all the worts
  will be drawn off the grains in the mash-tun. The worts of each brewing
  <ph outputclass="correction">must</ph> be
  collected within twelve hours of the commencement of the collection, and
  the brewer must within a given time enter in his book the quantity and
  gravity of the worts before fermentation, the number and name of the
  vessel, and the date of the entry. The worts must remain in the same
  vessel undisturbed for twelve hours after being collected, unless
  previously taken account of by the officer. There are other regulations,
  <i>e.g.</i> those prohibiting the mixing of worts of different brewings
  unless account has been taken of each separately, the alteration of the
  size or shape of any gauged vessel without notice, and so on.</p>

         <ph outputclass="sc">Materials used in Brewing</ph>.—These are
  water, malt (<i>q.v.</i>), hops (<i>q.v.</i>), various substitutes for
  the two latter, and preservatives.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Water</i>.—A satisfactory supply of water—which, it may
  here be mentioned, is always called <i>liquor</i> in the brewery—is
  a matter of great importance to the brewer. Certain waters, for instance,
  those contaminated to any extent with organic matter, cannot be used at
  all in brewing, as they give rise to unsatisfactory fermentation,
  cloudiness and abnormal flavour. Others again, although suited to the
  production of one type of beer, are quite unfit for the brewing of
  another. For black beers a soft water is a desideratum, for ales of the
  Burton type a hard water is a necessity. For the brewing of mild ales,
  again, a water containing a certain proportion of chlorides is required.
  The presence or absence of certain mineral substances as such in the
  finished beer is not, apparently, a matter of any moment as regards
  flavour or appearance, but the importance of the rôle played by these
  substances in the brewing process is due to the influence which they
  exert on the solvent action of the water on the various constituents of
  the malt, and possibly of the hops. The excellent quality of the Burton
  ales was long ago surmised to be due mainly to the well water obtainable
  in that town. On analysing Burton water it was found to contain a
  considerable quantity of calcium sulphate—gypsum—and of other
  calcium and magnesium salts, and it is now a well-known fact that good
  bitter ales cannot be brewed except with waters containing these
  substances in sufficient quantities. Similarly, good mild ale waters
  should contain a certain quantity of sodium chloride, and waters for
  stout very little mineral matter, excepting perhaps the carbonates of the
  alkaline earths, which are precipitated on boiling.</p>
      <p>The following analyses (from W.J. Sykes, <i>The Principles and
  Practice of Brewing</i>) are fairly illustrative of typical brewing
  waters.</p>

      <p>Our knowledge of the essential chemical constituents of brewing waters
  enables brewers in many cases to treat an unsatisfactory supply
  artificially in such a manner as to modify its character in a favourable
  sense. Thus, if a soft water only is to hand, and it is desired to brew a
  bitter ale, all that is necessary is to add a sufficiency of gypsum,
  magnesium sulphate and calcium chloride. If it is desired to convert a
  soft water lacking in chlorides into a satisfactory mild ale liquor, the
  addition of 30-40 grains of sodium chloride will be necessary. On the
  other hand, to convert a hard water into a soft supply is scarcely
  feasible for brewing purposes. To the substances used for treating
  brewing liquors already mentioned we may add kainite, a naturally
  deposited composite salt containing potassium and magnesium sulphates and
  magnesium chloride.</p>

         <i>Malt Substitutes.</i>—Prior to the repeal of the Malt Acts,
  the only substitute for malt allowed in the United Kingdom was sugar. The
  quantity of the latter employed was 295,865 cwt. in 1870, 1,136,434 cwt.
  in 1880, and 2,746,615 cwt. in 1905; that is to say, that the quantity
  used had been practically trebled during the last twenty-five years,
  although the quantity of malt employed had not materially increased. At
  the same time other substitutes, such as unmalted corn and preparations
  of rice and maize, had come into favour, the quantity of these substances
  used being in 1905 125,671 bushels of unmalted corn and 1,348,558 cwt. of
  rice, maize, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>The following statistics with regard to the use of malt substitutes in
  the United Kingdom are not without interest.</p>

      <p>The causes which have led to the largely increased use of substitutes
  in the United Kingdom are of a somewhat complex nature. In the first
  place, it was not until the malt tax was repealed that the brewer was
  able to avail himself of the surplus diastatic energy present in malt,
  for the purpose of transforming starch (other than that in malted grain)
  into sugar. The diastatic enzyme or ferment (see below, under
  <i>Mashing</i>) of malted barley is present in that material in great
  excess, and a part of this surplus energy may be usefully employed in
  converting the starch of unmalted grain into sugar. The brewer has found
  also that brewing operations are simplified and accelerated by the use of
  a certain proportion of substitutes, and that he is thereby enabled
  appreciably to increase his turn-over, <i>i.e.</i> he can make more beer
  in a given time from the same plant. Certain classes of substitutes, too,
  are somewhat cheaper than malt, and in view of the keenness of modern
  competition it is not to be wondered at that the brewer should resort to
  every legitimate means at his disposal to keep down costs. It has been
  contended, and apparently with much reason, that if the use of
  substitutes were prohibited this would not lead to an increased use of
  domestic barley, inasmuch as the supply of home barley suitable for
  malting purposes is of a limited nature. A return to the policy of "malt
  and hops only" would therefore lead to an increased use of foreign
  barley, and to a diminution in the demand for home barley, inasmuch as
  sugar and prepared cereals, containing as they do less nitrogen, &amp;c.
  than even the well-cured, sun-dried foreign barleys, are better diluents
  than the latter. At the same time, it is an undoubted fact that an
  excessive use of substitutes leads to the production of beer of poor
  quality. The better class of brewer rarely uses more than 15-20%, knowing
  that beyond that point the loss of flavour and quality will in the long
  run become a more serious item than any increased profits which he might
  temporarily gain.</p>
      <p>With regard to the nature of the substitutes or adjuncts for barley
  malt more generally employed, raw grain (unmalted barley, wheat, rice,
  maize, &amp;c.) is not used extensively in Great Britain, but in America
  brewers employ as much as 50%, and even more, of maize, rice or similar
  materials. The maize and rice preparations mostly used in England are
  practically starch pure and simple, substantially the whole of the oil,
  water, and other subsidiary constituents of the grain being removed. The
  germ of maize contains a considerable proportion of an oil of somewhat
  unpleasant flavour, which has to be eliminated before the material is fit
  for use in the mash-tun. After degerming, the maize is unhusked, wetted,
  submitted to a temperature sufficient to rupture the starch cells, dried,
  and finally rolled out in a flaky condition. Rice is similarly
  treated.</p>
      <p>The <i>sugars</i> used are chiefly cane sugar, glucose and invert
  sugar—the latter commonly known as "saccharum." Cane sugar is
  mostly used for the preparation of heavy mild ales and stouts, as it
  gives a peculiarly sweet and full flavour to the beer, to which, no
  doubt, the popularity of this class of beverage is largely due. <i>Invert
  sugar</i> is prepared by the action either of acid or of yeast on cane
  sugar. The chemical equation representing the conversion (or inversion)
  of cane sugar is:—</p>

      <p>Invert sugar is so called because the mixture of glucose and fructose
  which forms the "invert" is laevo-rotatory, whereas cane sugar is
  dextro-rotatory to the plane of polarized light. The preparation of
  invert sugar by the acid process consists in treating the cane sugar in
  solution with a little mineral acid, removing the excess of the latter by
  means of chalk, and concentrating to a thick syrup. The yeast process
  (Tompson's), which makes use of the inverting power of one of the enzymes
  (invertase) contained in ordinary yeast, is interesting. The cane sugar
  solution is pitched with yeast at about 55° C., and at this comparatively
  high temperature the inversion proceeds rapidly, and fermentation is
  practically impossible. When this operation is completed, the whole
  liquid (including the yeast) is run into the boiling contents of the
  copper. This method is more suited to the preparation of invert in the
  brewery itself than the acid process, which is almost exclusively used in
  special sugar works. Glucose, which is one of the constituents of invert
  sugar, is largely used by itself in brewing. It is, however, never
  prepared from invert sugar for this purpose, but directly from starch by
  means of acid. By the action of dilute boiling acid on starch the latter
  is rapidly converted first into a mixture of dextrine and maltose and
  then into glucose. The proportions of glucose, dextrine and maltose
  present in a commercial glucose depend very much on the duration of the
  boiling, the strength of the acid, and the extent of the pressure at
  which the starch is converted. In England the materials from which
  glucose is manufactured are generally sago, rice and purified maize. In
  Germany potatoes form the most common raw material, and in America
  purified Indian corn is ordinarily employed.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Hop substitutes</i>, as a rule, are very little used. They mostly
  consist of quassia, gentian and camomile, and these substitutes are quite
  harmless <i>per se</i>, but impart an unpleasantly rough and bitter taste
  to the beer.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Preservatives</i>.—These are generally, in fact almost
  universally, employed nowadays for draught ales; to a smaller extent for
  stock ales. The light beers in vogue to-day are less alcoholic, more
  lightly hopped, and more quickly brewed than the beers of the last
  generation, and in this respect are somewhat less stable and more likely
  to deteriorate than the latter were. The preservative in part replaces
  the alcohol and the hop extract, and shortens the brewing time. The
  preservatives mostly used are the bisulphites of lime and potash, and
  these, when employed in small quantities, are generally held to be
  harmless.</p>
      <p>
         <ph outputclass="sc">Brewing Operations</ph>.—The general scheme
  of operations in an English brewery will be readily understood if
  reference be made to fig. 1, which represents an 8-quarter brewery on the
  <i>gravitation system</i>, the principle of which is that all materials
  to be employed are pumped or hoisted to the highest point required, to
  start with, and that subsequently no further pumping or hoisting is
  required, the materials (in the shape of water, malt, wort or hops,
  &amp;c.) being conveyed from one point to another by the force of
  gravity.</p>
      <p>The malt, which is hoisted to the top floor, after cleaning and
  grading is conveyed to the <i>Malt Mill</i>, where it is crushed. Thence
  the ground malt, or "grist" as it is now called, passes to the <i>Grist
  Hopper</i>, and from the latter to the <i>Mashing Machine</i>, in which
  it is intimately mixed with hot water from the <i>Hot Liquor Vessel</i>.
  From the mashing machine the mixed grist and "liquor" pass to the
  <i>Mash-Tun</i>, where the starch of the malt is rendered soluble. From
  the mash-tun the clear wort passes to the <i>Copper</i>, where it is
  boiled with hops. From the copper the boiled wort passes to the <i>Hop
  Back</i>, where the insoluble hop constituents are separated from the
  wort. From the hop back the wort passes to the <i>Cooler</i>, from the
  latter to the <i>Refrigerator</i>, thence (for the purpose of enabling
  the revenue officers to assess the duty) to the <i>Collecting
  Vessel</i>,<xref href="#d1e1056/Footnote_044" type="fn"><!--[4]--></xref>
  and finally to the <i>Fermenting Vessels</i>, in which the wort is
  transformed into "green" beer. The latter is then cleansed, and finally
  racked and stored.</p>
      <p>It will be seen from the above that brewing consists of seven distinct
  main processes, which may be classed as follows: (1) Grinding; (2)
  Mashing; (3) Boiling; (4) Cooling; (5) Fermenting; (6) Cleansing; (7)
  Racking and Storing.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Grinding</i>.—In most modern breweries the malt passes, on
  its way <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page509">[v.04 p.0509]</ph>from the bins to the mill, through
  a cleaning and grading apparatus, and then through an automatic measuring
  machine. The mills, which exist in a variety of designs, are of the
  smooth roller type, and are so arranged that the malt is <i>crushed</i>
  rather than ground. If the malt is ground too fine, difficulties arise in
  regard to efficient drainage in the mash-tun and subsequent
  clarification. On the other hand, if the crushing is too coarse the
  subsequent extraction of soluble matter in the mash-tun is incomplete,
  and an inadequate yield results.</p>

         <i>Mashing</i> is a process which consists mainly in extracting, by
  means of water at an adequate temperature, the soluble matters
  pre-existent in the malt, and in converting the insoluble starch and a
  great part of the insoluble nitrogenous compounds into soluble and partly
  fermentable products. Mashing is, without a doubt, the most important of
  the brewing processes, for it is largely in the mash-tun that the
  character of the beer to be brewed is determined. In modern practice the
  malt and the mashing "liquor" (<i>i.e.</i> water) are introduced into the
  mash-tun simultaneously, by means of the mashing machine (fig. 2, A).
  This is generally a cylindrical metal vessel, commanding the mash-tun and
  provided with a central shaft and screw. The grist (as the crushed malt
  is called) enters the mashing machine from the grist case above, and the
  liquor is introduced at the back. The screw is rotated rapidly, and so a
  thorough mixture of the grist and liquor takes place as they travel along
  the mashing machine. The mash-tun (fig. 2) is a large metal or wooden
  vessel, fitted with a false bottom composed of plates perforated with
  numerous small holes or slits (C). This arrangement is necessary in order
  to obtain a proper separation of the "wort" (as the liquid portion of the
  finished mash is called) from the spent grains. The mash-tun is also
  provided with a stirring apparatus (the <i>rakes</i>) so that the grist
  and liquor may be intimately mixed (D), and an automatic sprinkler, the
  <i>sparger</i> (fig. 2, B, and fig. 3), which is employed in order to
  wash out the wort remaining in the grains. The sparger consists of a
  number of hollow arms radiating from a common centre and pierced by a
  number of small perforations. The common central vessel from which the
  sparge-arms radiate is mounted in such a manner that it rotates
  automatically when a stream of water is admitted, so that a constant fine
  spray covers the whole tun when the sparger is in operation. There are
  also pipes for admitting "liquor" to the bottom of the tun, and for
  carrying the wort from the latter to the "underback" or "copper."</p>
      <p>The grist and liquor having been introduced into the tun (either by
  means of the mashing machine or separately), the rakes are set going, so
  that the mash may become thoroughly homogeneous, and after a short time
  the rakes are stopped and the mash allowed to rest, usually for a period
  of about two hours. After this, "taps are set"—<i>i.e.</i>
  communication is established between the mash-tun and the vessel into
  which the wort runs—and the sparger is started. In this manner the
  whole of the wort or extract is separated from the grains. The quantity
  of water employed is, in all, from two to three barrels to the quarter
  (336 lb) of malt.</p>
      <p>In considering the process of mashing, one might almost say the
  process of brewing, it is essential to remember that the type and quality
  of the beer to be produced (see <ph outputclass="sc">Malt</ph>) depends
  almost entirely (<i>a</i>) on the kind of malt employed, and (<i>b</i>)
  on the mashing temperature. In other words, quality may be controlled on
  the kiln or in the mash-tun, or both. Viewed in this light, the following
  theoretical methods for preparing different types of beer are
  possible:—(1) high kiln heats and high mashing temperatures; (2)
  high kiln heats and low mashing temperatures; (3) low kiln heats and high
  mashing temperatures; and (4) low kiln heats and low mashing
  temperatures. In practice all these combinations, together with many
  intermediate ones, are met with, and it is not too much to say that the
  whole science of modern brewing is based upon them. It is plain, then,
  that the mashing temperature will depend on the kind of beer that is to
  be produced, and on the kind of malt employed. For stouts and black beers
  generally, a mashing temperature of 148° to 150° F. is most usual; for
  pale or stock ales, 150° to 154° F.; and for mild running beers, 154° to
  149° F. The range of temperatures employed in brewing English beers is a
  very limited one as compared with foreign mashing methods, and does not
  range further, practically speaking, than from 140° to 160° F. The effect
  of higher temperatures is chiefly to cripple the enzyme or "ferment"
  diastase, which, as already said, is the agent which converts the
  insoluble starch into soluble dextrin, sugar and intermediate products.
  The higher the mashing temperature, the more the diastase will be
  crippled in its action, and the more dextrinous (non-fermentable) matter
  as compared with maltose (fermentable sugar) will be formed. A pale or
  stock ale, which is a type of beer that must be "dry" and that will keep,
  requires to contain a relatively high proportion of dextrin and little
  maltose, and, in its preparation, therefore, a high mashing temperature
  will be employed. On the other hand, a mild running ale, which is a full,
  sweet beer, intended for rapid consumption, will be obtained by means of
  low mashing temperatures, which produce relatively little dextrin, but a
  good deal of maltose, <i>i.e.</i> sweet and readily fermentable
  matter.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Diastase is not the only enzyme present in malt. There is also a
  ferment which renders a part of the nitrogenous matter soluble. This
  again is affected by temperature in much the same way as diastase. Low
  heats tend to produce much non-coagulable <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page510">[v.04 p.0510]</ph>nitrogenous
  matter, which is undesirable in a stock beer, as it tends to produce fret
  and side fermentations. With regard to the kind of malt and other
  materials employed in producing various types of beer, pale ales are made
  either from pale malt (generally a mixture of English and fine foreign,
  such as Smyrna, California) only, or from pale malt and a little flaked
  maize, rice, invert sugar or glucose. Running beers (mild ale) are made
  from a mixture of pale and amber malts, sugar and flaked goods; stout,
  from a mixture of pale, amber and roasted (black) malts only, or with the
  addition of a little sugar or flaked maize.</p>
      <p>When raw grain is employed, the process of mashing is slightly
  modified. The maize, rice or other grain is usually gelatinized in a
  vessel (called a <i>converter</i> or <i>cooker</i>) entirely separated
  from the mash-tun, by means of steam at a relatively high temperature,
  mostly with, but occasionally without, the addition of some malt meal.
  After about half an hour the gelatinized mass is mixed with the main
  mash, and this takes place shortly before taps are set. This is possible
  inasmuch as the starch, being already in a highly disintegrated
  condition, is very rapidly converted. By working on the limited-decoction
  system (see below), it is possible to make use of a fair percentage of
  raw grain in the mash-tun proper, thus doing away with the "converter"
  entirely.</p>
      <p>
         <i>The Filter Press Process.</i>—The ordinary mash-tun process,
  as described above, possesses the disadvantage that only coarse grists
  can be employed. This entails loss of extract in several ways. To begin
  with, the sparging process is at best a somewhat inefficient method for
  washing out the last portions of the wort, and again, when the malt is at
  all hard or "steely," starch conversion is by no means complete. These
  disadvantages are overcome by the filter press process, which was first
  introduced into Great Britain by the Belgian engineer P. Meura. The malt,
  in this method of brewing, is ground quite fine, and although an ordinary
  mash-tun may be used for mashing, the separation of the clear wort from
  the solid matter takes place in the filter press, which retains the very
  finest particles with ease. It is also a simple matter to wash out the
  wort from the filter cake in the presses, and experience has shown that
  markedly increased yields are thus obtained. In the writer's opinion,
  there is little doubt that in the future this, or a similar process, will
  find a very wide application.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Boiling</i>.—From the mash-tun the wort passes to the
  <i>copper</i>. If it is not possible to arrange the plant so that the
  coppers are situated beneath the mash-tuns (as is the case in breweries
  arranged on the <i>gravitation system</i>), an intermediate collecting
  vessel (the underback) is interposed, and from this the wort is pumped
  into the copper. The latter is a large copper vessel heated by direct
  fire or steam. Modern coppers are generally closed in with a dome-shaped
  head, but many old-fashioned open coppers are still to be met with, in
  fact pale-ale brewers prefer open coppers. In the closed type the wort is
  frequently boiled under slight pressure. When the wort has been raised to
  the boil, the hops or a part thereof are added, and the boiling is
  continued generally from an hour to three hours, according to the type of
  beer. The objects of boiling, briefly put, are: (1) sterilization of the
  wort; (2) extraction from the hops of substances that give flavour and
  aroma to the beer; (3) the coagulation and precipitation of a part of the
  nitrogenous matter (the coagulable albuminoids), which, if left in, would
  cause cloudiness and fret, &amp;c., in the finished beer; (4) the
  concentration of the wort. At least three distinct substances are
  extracted from the hops in boiling. First, the <i>hop tannin</i>, which,
  combining with a part of the proteids derived from the malt, precipitates
  them; second, the <i>hop resin</i>, which acts as a preservative and
  bitter; third, the <i>hop oil</i>, to which much of the fine aroma of
  beer is due. The latter is volatile, and it is customary, therefore, not
  to add the whole of the hops to the wort when it commences to boil, but
  to reserve about a third until near the end of the copper stage. The
  quantity of hops employed varies according to the type of beer, from
  about 3 lb to 15 lb per quarter (336 lb) of malt. For mild ales and
  porters about 3 to 4 lb, for light pale ales and light stouts 6 to 10 lb,
  and for strong ales and stouts 9 to 15 lb of hops are employed.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Cooling</i>.—When the wort has boiled the necessary time, it
  is turned into the <i>hop back</i> to settle. A hop back is a wooden or
  metal vessel, fitted with a false bottom of perforated plates; the latter
  retain the spent hops, the wort being drawn off into the coolers. After
  resting for a brief period in the hop back, the bright wort is run into
  the <i>coolers</i>. The cooler is a very shallow vessel of great area,
  and the result of the exposure of the hot wort to a comparatively large
  volume of air is that a part of the hop constituents and other substances
  contained in the wort are rendered insoluble and are precipitated. It was
  formerly considered absolutely essential that this hot aeration should
  take place, but in many breweries nowadays coolers are not used, the wort
  being run direct from the hop back to the refrigerator. There is much to
  be said for this procedure, as the exposure of hot wort in the cooler is
  attended with much danger of bacterial and wild yeast infection, but it
  is still a moot point whether the cooler or its equivalent can be
  entirely dispensed with for all classes of beers. A rational alteration
  would appear to be to place the cooler in an air-tight chamber supplied
  with purified and sterilized air. This principle has already been applied
  to the refrigerator, and apparently with success. In America the cooler
  is frequently replaced by a cooling tank, an enclosed vessel of some
  depth, capable of artificial aeration. It is not practicable, in any
  case, to cool the wort sufficiently on the cooler to bring it to the
  proper temperature for the fermentation stage, and for this purpose,
  therefore, the <i>refrigerator</i> is employed. There are several kinds
  of refrigerators, the main distinction being that some are vertical,
  others horizontal; but the principle in each case is much the same, and
  consists in allowing a thin film or stream of wort to trickle over a
  series of pipes through which cold water circulates. Fig. 5, Plate I.,
  shows refrigerators, employed in Messrs Allsopp's lager beer brewery, at
  work.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Fermenting</i>.—By the process of fermentation the wort is
  converted into beer. By the action of living yeast cells (see <ph outputclass="sc">Fermentation</ph>) the sugar contained in the wort is split
  up into alcohol and carbonic acid, and a number of subsidiary reactions
  occur. There are two main systems of fermentation, the <i>top
  fermentation</i> system, which is that employed in the United Kingdom,
  and the <i>bottom fermentation</i> system, which is that used for the
  production of beers of the continental ("lager") type. The wort,
  generally at a temperature of about 60° F. (this applies to all the
  systems excepting B [see below], in which the temperature is higher), is
  "pitched" with liquid yeast (or "barm," as it is often called) at the
  rate of, according to the type and strength of the beer to be made, 1 to
  4 lb to the barrel. After a few hours a slight froth or scum makes its
  appearance on the surface of the liquid. At the end of a further short
  period this develops into a light curly mass (<i>cauliflower</i> or
  <i>curly head</i>), which gradually becomes lighter and more solid in
  appearance, and is then known as <i>rocky head</i>. This in its turn
  shrinks to a compact mass—the <i>yeasty head</i>—which emits
  great bubbles of gas with a hissing sound. At this point the
  <i>cleansing</i> of the beer—<i>i.e.</i> the separation of the
  yeast from the liquid—has fairly commenced, and it is let down
  (except in the skimming and Yorkshire systems [see below]) into the
  pontos or unions, as the case may be. During fermentation the temperature
  rises considerably, and in order to prevent an excessive temperature
  being obtained (70-75° F. should be the maximum) the fermenting vessels
  are fitted with "attemperators," <i>i.e.</i> a system of pipes through
  which cold water may be run.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Cleansing</i>.—In England the methods of applying the top
  fermentation system may be classified as follows: (A) <i>The Cleansing

      <p>(A) In (<i>a</i>) the <i>Skimming System</i> the fermentation from
  start to finish takes place in wooden vessels (termed "squares" or
  "rounds"), fitted with an attemperator and a parachute or other similar
  skimming device for removing or "skimming" the yeast at the end of the
  fermentation (fig. 4). The principle of (<i>b</i>) the <i>Dropping
  System</i> is that the beer undergoes only the main fermentation in the
  "round" or "square," and is then dropped down into a second vessel or
  vessels, in which fermentation and cleansing are completed. The
  <i>ponto</i> system of dropping, which is now somewhat old-fashioned,
  consists in discharging the beer into a series of vat-like vessels,
  fitted with a peculiarly-shaped overflow lip. The yeast works its way out
  of the vessel over the lip, and then flows into a gutter and is
  collected. The pontos are kept filled with beer by means of a vessel
  placed at a higher level. In the <i>ordinary</i> dropping system the
  partly fermented beer is let down from the "squares" and "rounds" into
  large vessels, termed dropping or skimming "backs." These are fitted with
  attemperators, and parachutes for the removal of yeast, in much the same
  way as in the skimming system. As a rule the parachute covers the whole
  width of the back. (<i>c</i>) The <i>Burton Union System</i> is really an
  improved ponto system. A series of casks, supplied with beer at the
  cleansing stage from a feed vessel, are mounted so that they may rotate
  axially. Each cask is fitted with an attemperator, a pipe and cock at the
  base for the removal of the finished beer and "bottoms," and lastly with
  a swan neck fitting through a bung-hole and commanding a common gutter.
  This system yields excellent results for certain classes of beers, and
  many Burton brewers think it is essential for obtaining <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page511">[v.04 p.0511]</ph>the
  Burton character. Fig. 6 (Plate II.) shows the process in operation in
  Messrs Allsopp's brewery.</p>
      <p>(B) <i>The Stone Square System</i>, which is only used to a certain
  extent (exclusively in the north of England), practically consists in
  pumping the fermenting wort from one to the other of two superimposed
  square vessels, connected with one another by means of a man-hole and a
  valve. These squares are built of stone and kept very cool. At the end of
  the fermentation the yeast (after closing the man-hole) is removed from
  the top square.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Racking, &amp;c.</i>—After the fermentation and cleansing
  operations are completed, the beer is racked off (sometimes after passing
  a few hours in a settling tank) into storage vessels or trade casks. The
  finest "stock" and "pale" ales are stored from six weeks to three months
  prior to going out, but "running" beers (mild ales, &amp;c.) are
  frequently sent out of the brewery within a week or ten days of mashing.
  It is usual to add some hops in cask (this is called <i>dry hopping</i>)
  in the case of many of the better beers. Running beers, which must be put
  into condition rapidly, or beers that have become flat, are generally
  <i>primed</i>. Priming consists in adding a small quantity of sugar
  solution to the beer in cask. This rapidly ferments and so produces
  "condition."</p>
      <p>
         <i>Fining</i>.—As a very light article is desired nowadays, and
  this has to be provided in a short time, artificial means must be
  resorted to, in order to replace the natural fining or brightening which
  storage brings about. <i>Finings</i> generally consist of a solution or
  semi-solution of isinglass in sour beer, or in a solution of tartaric
  acid or of sulphurous acid. After the finings are added to the beer and
  the barrels have been well rolled, the finings slowly precipitate (or
  work out through the bung-hole) and carry with them the matter which
  would otherwise render the beer turbid.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Bottling</i>.—Formerly it was the general custom to brew a
  special beer for bottling, and this practice is still continued by some
  brewers. It is generally admitted that the special brew, matured by
  storage and an adequate secondary fermentation, produces the best beer
  for bottling, but the modern taste for a very light and bright bottled
  beer at a low cost has necessitated the introduction of new methods. The
  most interesting among these is the "chilling" and "carbonating" system.
  In this the beer, when it is ripe for racking, is first "chilled," that
  is, cooled to a very low temperature. As a result, there is an immediate
  deposition of much matter which otherwise would require prolonged time to
  settle. The beer is then filtered and so rendered quite bright, and
  finally, in order to produce immediate "condition," is "carbonated,"
  <i>i.e.</i> impregnated under pressure with carbon dioxide (carbonic acid
  gas).</p>
      <p>
         <ph outputclass="sc">Foreign Brewing and Beers.</ph>—The system of
  brewing which differs most widely from the English <i>infusion</i> and
  <i>top fermentation</i> method is the <i>decoction</i> and <i>bottom
  fermentation</i> system, so widely employed, chiefly on the continent of
  Europe, for the production of beers of the "lager" type.</p>
      <p>The method pursued in the decoction system is broadly as
  follows:—After the grist has been mashed with cold water until a
  homogeneous mixture ensues, sufficient hot water is introduced into the
  mash-tun to raise the temperature to 85-100° F., according to
  circumstances. Thereupon, about one-third of the mash (including the
  "goods") is transferred to the <i>Maisch Kessel</i> (mash copper), in
  which it is gradually brought to a temperature of (about) 165° F., and
  this heat is maintained until the mash becomes transparent. The
  <i>Dickmaische</i>, as this portion is called, is then raised to the
  boil, and the ebullition sustained between a quarter and three-quarters
  of an hour. Just sufficient of the <i>Dickmaische</i> is returned to the
  mash-tun proper to raise the temperature of the whole to 111-125° F., and
  after a few minutes a third is again withdrawn and treated as before, to
  form the second "thick mash." When the latter has been returned to the
  mash-tun the whole is thoroughly worked up, allowed to stand in order
  that the solids may deposit, and then another third (called the
  <i>Läutermaische</i> or "clear mash") is withdrawn, boiled until the
  coagulable albuminoids are precipitated, and finally reconveyed to the
  mash-tun, where the mashing is continued for some time, the final heat
  being rather over 160° F. The wort, after boiling with hops and cooling,
  much as in the English system, is subjected to the peculiar system of
  fermentation called <i>bottom fermentation</i>. In this system the
  "pitching" and fermentation take place at a very low temperature and,
  compared with the English system, in very small vessels. The fermenting
  cellars are maintained at a temperature of about 37-38° F., and the
  temperature of the fermenting wort does not rise above 50° F. The yeast,
  which is of a different type from that employed in the English system,
  remains at the bottom of the fermenting tun, and hence is derived the
  name of "bottom fermentation" (see <ph outputclass="sc">Fermentation</ph>).
  The primary fermentation lasts about eleven to twelve days (as compared
  with three days on the English system), and the beer is then run into
  store (lager) casks where it remains at a temperature approaching the
  freezing-point of water for six weeks to six months, according to the
  time of the year and the class of the beer. As to the relative character
  and stability of decoction and infusion beers, the latter are, as a rule,
  more alcoholic; but the former contain more unfermented malt extract, and
  are therefore, broadly speaking, more nutritive. Beers of the German type
  are less heavily hopped and more peptonized than English beers, and more
  highly charged with carbonic acid, which, owing to the low fermentation
  and storing temperatures, is retained for a comparatively long time and
  keeps the beer in condition. On the other hand, infusion beers are of a
  more stable and stimulating character. It is impossible to keep "lager"
  beer on draught in the ordinary sense of the term in England. It will not
  keep unless placed on ice, and, as a matter of fact, the "condition" of
  lager is dependent to a far greater extent on the methods of distribution
  and storage than is the case with infusion beers. If a cask is opened it
  must be rapidly consumed; indeed it becomes undrinkable within a very few
  hours. The gas escapes rapidly when the pressure is released, the
  temperature rises, and the beer becomes flat and mawkish. In Germany
  every publican is bound to have an efficient supply of ice, the latter
  frequently being delivered by the brewery together with the beer.</p>
      <p>In America the common system of brewing is one of infusion mashing
  combined with bottom fermentation. The method of mashing, however, though
  on infusion lines, differs appreciably from the English process. A very
  low initial heat—about 100° F.—at which the mash remains for
  about an hour, is employed. After this the temperature is rapidly raised
  to 153-156° F. by running in the boiling "cooker mash," <i>i.e.</i> raw
  grain wort from the converter. After a period the temperature is
  gradually increased to about 165° F. The very low initial heat, and the
  employment of relatively large quantities of readily transformable malt
  adjuncts, enable the American brewer to make use of a class of malt which
  would be considered quite unfit for brewing in an English brewery. The
  system of fermentation is very similar to the continental "lager" system,
  and the beer obtained bears some resemblance to the German product. To
  the English palate it is somewhat flavourless, but it is always retailed
  in exceedingly brilliant condition and at a proper temperature. There can
  be little doubt that every nation evolves a type of beer most suited to
  its climate and the temperament of the people, and in this respect the
  modern American beer is no exception. In regard to plant and mechanical
  arrangements generally, the modern American breweries may serve as an
  object-lesson to the European brewer, although there are certainly a
  number of breweries in the United Kingdom which need not fear comparison
  with the best American plants.</p>
      <p>It is a sign of the times and further evidence as to the growing taste
  for a lighter type of beer, that lager brewing in its most modern form
  has now fairly taken root in Great Britain, and in this connexion the
  process introduced by Messrs Allsopp exhibits many features of interest.
  The following is a brief description of the plant and the methods
  employed:—The wort is prepared on infusion lines, and is then
  cooled by means of refrigerated brine before passing to a temporary store
  tank, which serves as a gauging vessel. From the latter the wort passes
  directly to the fermenting tuns, huge closed cylindrical vessels made of
  sheet-steel and coated with glass enamel. There the wort ferments under
  reduced pressure, the carbonic acid generated being removed by means of a
  vacuum pump, and the gas thus withdrawn is replaced by the introduction
  of cool sterilized air. The fermenting cellars are kept at 40° F. The
  yeast employed is a pure culture (see <ph outputclass="sc">Fermentation</ph>) bottom yeast, but the withdrawal of the
  products of yeast metabolism and the constant supply of pure fresh air
  cause the fermentation to proceed far more rapidly than is the case with
  lager beer brewed on ordinary lines. It is, in fact, finished in about
  six days. Thereupon the air-supply is cut off, the green beer again
  cooled to 40° F. and <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page512">[v.04 p.0512]</ph>then conveyed by means of filtered
  air pressure to the store tanks, where secondary fermentation, lasting
  three weeks, takes place. The gases evolved are allowed to collect under
  pressure, so that the beer is thoroughly charged with the carbonic acid
  necessary to give it condition. Finally the beer is again cooled,
  filtered, racked and bottled, the whole of these operations taking place
  under counter pressure, so that no gas can escape; indeed, from the time
  the wort leaves the copper to the moment when it is bottled in the shape
  of beer, it does not come into contact with the outer air.</p>
      <p>The preparation of the Japanese beer <i>saké</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) is of
  interest. The first stage consists in the preparation of <i>Koji</i>,
  which is obtained by treating steamed rice with a culture of
  <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>. This micro-organism converts the starch into
  sugar. The <i>Koji</i> is converted into <i>moto</i> by adding it to a
  thin paste of fresh-boiled starch in a vat. Fermentation is set up and
  lasts for 30 to 40 days. The third stage consists in adding more rice and
  <i>Koji</i> to the <i>moto</i>, together with some water. A secondary
  fermentation, lasting from 8 to 10 days, ensues. Subsequently the whole
  is filtered, heated and run into casks, and is then known as <i>saké</i>.
  The interest of this process consists in the fact that a single
  micro-organism—a mould—is able to exercise the combined
  functions of saccharification and fermentation. It replaces the diastase
  of malted grain and also the yeast of a European brewery. Another liquid
  of interest is <i>Weissbier</i>. This, which is largely produced in
  Berlin (and in some respects resembles the <i>wheat-beer</i> produced in
  parts of England), is generally prepared from a mash of three parts of
  wheat malt and one part of barley malt. The fermentation is of a
  symbiotic nature, two organisms, namely a yeast and a fission fungus (the
  <i>lactic acid bacillus</i>) taking part in it. The preparation of this
  peculiar double ferment is assisted by the addition of a certain quantity
  of white wine to the yeast prior to fermentation.</p>
      <p>
         <ph outputclass="sc">Brewing Chemistry</ph>.—The principles of
  brewing technology belong for the most part to physiological chemistry,
  whilst those of the cognate industry, malting, are governed exclusively
  by that branch of knowledge. Alike in following the growth of barley in
  field, its harvesting, maturing and conversion into malt, as well as the
  operations of mashing malt, fermenting wort, and conditioning beer,
  physiological chemistry is needed. On the other hand, the consideration
  of the saline matter in waters, the composition of the extract of worts
  and beers, and the analysis of brewing materials and products generally,
  belong to the domain of pure chemistry. Since the extractive matters
  contained in wort and beer consist for the most part of the
  transformation products of starch, it is only natural that these should
  have received special attention at the hands of scientific men associated
  with the brewing industry. It was formerly believed that by the action of
  diastase on starch the latter is first converted into a gummy substance
  termed dextrin, which is then subsequently transformed into a
  sugar—glucose. F.A. Musculus, however, in 1860, showed that sugar
  and dextrin are simultaneously produced, and between the years 1872 and
  1876 Cornelius O'Sullivan definitely proved that the sugar produced was
  maltose. When starch-paste, the jelly formed by treating starch with
  boiling water, is mixed with iodine solution, a deep blue coloration
  results. The first product of starch degradation by either acids or
  diastase, namely soluble starch, also exhibits the same coloration when
  treated with iodine. As degradation proceeds, and the products become
  more and more soluble and diffusible, the blue reaction with iodine gives
  place first to a purple, then to a reddish colour, and finally the
  coloration ceases altogether. In the same way, the optical rotating power
  decreases, and the cupric reducing power (towards Fehling's solution)
  increases, as the process of hydrolysis proceeds. C. O'Sullivan was the
  first to point out definitely the influence of the temperature of the
  mash on the character of the products. The work of Horace T. Brown (with
  J. Heron) extended that of O'Sullivan, and (with G.H. Morris) established
  the presence of an intermediate product between the higher dextrins and
  maltose. This product was termed maltodextrin, and Brown and Morris were
  led to believe that a large number of these substances existed in malt
  wort. They proposed for these substances the generic name "amyloins."
  Although according to their view they were compounds of maltose and
  dextrin, they had the properties of mixtures of these two substances. On
  the assumption of the existence of these compounds, Brown and his
  colleagues formulated what is known as the maltodextrin or amyloin
  hypothesis of starch degradation. C.J. Lintner, in 1891, claimed to have
  separated a sugar, isomeric with maltose, which is termed isomaltose,
  from the products of starch hydrolysis. A.R. Ling and J.L. Baker, as well
  as Brown and Morris, in 1895, proved that this isomaltose was not a
  homogeneous substance, and evidence tending to the same conclusion was
  subsequently brought forward by continental workers. Ling and Baker, in
  1897, isolated the following compounds from the products of starch
  hydrolysis—maltodextrin-<ph outputclass="grk">α</ph>,
  C<sub>36</sub>H<sub>62</sub>O<sub>31</sub>, and maltodextrin-<ph outputclass="grk">β</ph>, C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>42</sub>O<sub>21</sub>
  (previously named by Prior, achroodextrin III.). They also separated a
  substance, C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>, isomeric with
  maltose, which had, however, the characteristics of a dextrin. This is
  probably identical with the so-called dextrinose isolated by V. Syniewski
  in 1902, which yields a phenylosazone melting at 82-83° C. It has been
  proved by H. Ost that the so-called isomaltose of Lintner is a mixture of
  maltose and another substance, maltodextrin, isomeric with Ling and
  Baker's maltodextrin-<ph outputclass="grk">β</ph>.</p>
      <p>The theory of Brown and Morris of the degradation of starch, although
  based on experimental evidence of some weight, is by no means universally
  accepted. Nevertheless it is of considerable interest, as it offers a
  rational and consistent explanation of the phenomena known to accompany
  the transformation of starch by diastase, and even if not strictly
  correct it has, at any rate, proved itself to be a practical working
  hypothesis, by which the mashing and fermenting operations may be
  regulated and controlled. According to Brown and Morris, the starch
  molecule consists of five amylin groups, each of which corresponds to the
  molecular formula
  (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O<sub>10</sub>)<sub>20</sub>. Four of these
  amylin radicles are grouped centrally round the fifth, thus:—</p>

      <p>The amyloins are substances containing varying numbers of amylin
  (original starch or dextrin) groups in conjunction with a proportional
  number of maltose groups. They are not separable into maltose and dextrin
  by any of the ordinary means, but exhibit the properties of mixtures of
  these substances. As the process of hydrolysis proceeds, the amyloins
  become gradually poorer in amylin and relatively richer in
  maltose-groups. The final products of transformation, according to Brown
  and J.H. Millar, are maltose and glucose, which latter is derived from
  the hydrolysis of the stable dextrin. This theory may be applied in
  practical brewing in the following manner. If it is desired to obtain a
  beer of a stable character—that is to say, one containing a
  considerable proportion of high-type amyloins—it is necessary to
  restrict the action of the diastase in the mash-tun accordingly. On the
  other hand, for mild running ales, which are to "condition" rapidly, it
  is necessary to provide for the presence of sufficient maltodextrin of a
  low type. Investigation has shown that the type of maltodextrin can be
  regulated, not only in the mash-tun but also on the malt-kiln. A higher
  type is obtained by low kiln and high mashing temperatures than by high
  kiln and low mashing heats, and it is possible therefore to regulate, on
  scientific lines, not only the quality but also the type of amyloins
  which are suitable for a particular beer.</p>
      <p>The chemistry of the nitrogenous constituents of malt is equally
  important with that of starch and its transformations. Without
  nitrogenous compounds of the proper type, vigorous fermentations are not
  possible. It may be remembered that yeast assimilates nitrogenous
  compounds in some of their simpler forms—amides and the like. One
  of the aims of the maltster is, therefore, to break down the protein
  substances present in barley to such a degree that the wort has a maximum
  nutritive value for the yeast. Further, it is necessary for the
  production of stable beer to eliminate a large proportion of nitrogenous
  matter, and this is only done by the yeast when the proteins are
  degraded. There is also some evidence that the presence of albumoses
  assists in producing the foaming properties of beer. It has now been
  established definitely, by the work of A. Fernbach, W. Windisch, F.Weiss
  and P. Schidrowitz, that finished malt contains at least two proteolytic
  enzymes (a peptic and a pancreatic enzyme).</p>

            <p>The hot wort trickles over the outside of the series of
    pipes, and is cooled by the cold water which circulates in them. From
    the shallow collecting trays the cooled wort is conducted to the
    fermenting backs.</p>

      <p>The presence of different types of phosphates in malt, and the
  important influence which, according to their nature, they exercise in
  the brewing process by way of the enzymes affected by them, have been
  made the subject of research mainly by Fernbach and A. Hubert, and by
  P.E. Petit and G. Labourasse. The number of enzymes which are now known
  to take part in the brewing process is very large. They may with utility
  be grouped as follows:—</p>
