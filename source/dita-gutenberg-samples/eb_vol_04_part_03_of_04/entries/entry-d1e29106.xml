      <p><!--BUCH, CHRISTIAN LEOPOLD VON,--> <ph outputclass="sc">Baron</ph>
  (1774-1853), German geologist and geographer, a member of an ancient and
  noble Prussian family, was born at Stolpe in Pomerania on the 26th of
  April 1774. In 1790-1793 he studied at the mining school of Freiberg
  under Werner, one of his fellow-students there being Alexander von
  Humboldt. He afterwards completed his education at the universities of
  Halle and Göttingen. His <i>Versuch einer mineralogischen Beschreibung
  von Landeck</i> (Breslau, 1797) was translated into French (Paris, 1805),
  and into English as <i>Attempt at a Mineralogical Description of
  Landeck</i> (Edinburgh, 1810); he also published in 1802 <i>Entwurf einer
  geognostischen Beschreibung von Schlesien (Geognostische Beobachtungen
  auf Reisen durch Deutschland und Italien</i>, Band i.). He was at this
  time a zealous upholder of the Neptunian theory of his illustrious
  master. In 1797 he met Humboldt at Salzburg, and with him explored the
  geological formations of Styria, and the adjoining Alps. In the spring of
  the following year, von Buch extended his excursions into Italy, where
  his faith in the Neptunian theory was shaken. In his previous works he
  had advocated the aqueous origin of basaltic and other formations. In
  1799 he paid his first visit to Vesuvius, and again in 1805 he returned
  to study the volcano, accompanied by Humboldt and Gay Lussac. They had
  the good fortune to witness a remarkable eruption, which supplied von
  Buch with data for refuting many erroneous ideas then entertained
  regarding volcanoes. In 1802 he had explored the extinct volcanoes of
  Auvergne. The aspect of the Puy de Dôme, with its cone of trachyte and
  its strata of basaltic lava, induced him to abandon as untenable the
  doctrines of Werner on the formation of these rocks. The scientific
  results of his investigations he embodied in his <i>Geognostische
  Beobachtungen auf Reisen durch Deutschland und Italien</i> (Berlin,
  1802-1809). From the south of Europe von Buch repaired to the north, and
  spent two years among the Scandinavian islands, making many important
  observations on the geography of plants, on climatology and on geology.
  He showed that many of the erratic blocks on the North German plains must
  have come from Scandinavia. He also established the fact that the whole
  of Sweden is slowly but continuously rising above the level of the sea
  from Frederikshald to Abo. The details of these discoveries are given in
  his <i>Reise durch Norwegen und Lappland</i> (Berlin, 1810). In 1815 he
  visited the Canary Islands in company with Christian Smith, the Norwegian
  botanist. His observations here convinced him that these and other
  islands of the Atlantic owed their existence to volcanic action of the
  most intense kind, and that the groups of islands in the South Sea are
  the remains of a pre-existing continent. The physical description of the
  Canary Islands was published at Berlin in 1825, and this work alone is
  regarded as an enduring monument of his labours. After leaving the
  Canaries von Buch proceeded to the Hebrides and the coasts of Scotland
  and Ireland. Palaeontology also claimed his attention, and he described
  in 1831 and later years a number of Cephalopods, Brachiopods and
  Cystidea, and pointed out their stratigraphical importance. In addition
  to the works already mentioned von Buch published in 1832 the magnificent
  <i>Geological Map of Germany</i> (42 sheets, Berlin). His geological
  excursions were continued without interruption till his 78th year. Eight
  months before his death he visited <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page714">[v.04 p.0714]</ph>the mountains
  of Auvergne; and on returning home he read a paper on the Jurassic
  formation before the Academy of Berlin. He died at Berlin on the 4th of
  March 1853. Von Buch had inherited from his father a fortune more than
  sufficient for his wants. He was never married, and was unembarrassed by
  family ties. His excursions were always taken on foot, with a staff in
  his hand, and the large pockets of his overcoat filled with papers and
  geological instruments. Under this guise, the passer-by would not easily
  have recognized the man whom Humboldt pronounced the greatest geologist
  of his time.</p>
      <p>A complete edition of his works was published at Berlin
  (1867-1885).</p>
