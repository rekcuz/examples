      <p><!--BROUWER,--> or <ph outputclass="sc">Brauwer</ph>, <b>ADRIAN</b>
  (1608-1640), Dutch painter, was born at Haarlem, of very humble parents,
  who bound him apprentice to the painter Frans Hals. Brouwer had an
  admirable eye for colour, and much spirit in design; and these gifts his
  master appears to have turned to his own profit, while his pupil was half
  starved. As the result of this ungenerous <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page657">[v.04 p.0657]</ph>treatment,
  Brouwer was frequently brought into low company and dissipated scenes,
  which he delineated with great spirit and vivid colouring in his
  pictures. The unfortunate artist died in a hospital at Antwerp at the
  early age of thirty-two, consequently his works are few and rarely met
  with. The largest collection of his masterpieces is in the Pinakothek at
  Munich.</p>
