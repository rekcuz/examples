   <body>
      <p><!--BRUNCK, RICHARD FRANÇOIS PHILIPPE--> (1729-1803), French classical
  scholar, was born at Strassburg on the 30th of December 1729. He was
  educated at the Jesuits' College at Paris, and took part in the Seven
  Years' War as military commissary. At the age of thirty he returned to
  his native town and resumed his studies, paying special attention to
  Greek. He spent considerable sums of money in publishing editions of the
  Greek classics. The first work which he edited was the <i>Anthologia
  Graeca</i> or <i>Analecta veterum Poetarum Graecorum</i> (1772-1776), in
  which his innovations on the established mode of criticism startled
  European scholars; for wherever it seemed to him that an obscure or
  difficult passage might be made intelligible and easy by a change of
  text, he did not scruple to make the necessary alterations, whether the
  new reading were supported by manuscript authority or not. Other works by
  him are:—Editions of Anacreon (1778), several plays of the Greek
  tragedians, Apollonius Rhodius (1780), Aristophanes, with an excellent
  Latin translation (1781-1783), <i>Gnomici poetae Graeci</i> (1784),
  Sophocles (1786), with Latin translation, his best work, for which he
  received a pension of 2000 francs from the king. He also published
  editions of Virgil (1785), Plautus (1788) and Terence (1797). At the
  outbreak of the French Revolution, in which he took an active part, he
  was imprisoned at Besançon, and lost his pension, being reduced to such
  extremities that he was obliged to sell a portion of his library. In 1802
  his pension was restored to him, but too late to prevent the sale of the
  remainder of his books. He died on the 12th of June 1803.</p>
