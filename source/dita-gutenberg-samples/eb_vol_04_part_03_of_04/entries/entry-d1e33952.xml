      <p><!--BUILDING.--><xref href="#d1e33952/Footnote_361" type="fn"><!--[1]--></xref> The art of building comprises the
  practice of civil architecture, or the mechanical operations necessary to
  <ph outputclass="sidenote">Relation of building to architecture.</ph> carry
  the designs of the architect into effect. It is not infrequently called
  "practical architecture," but the adoption of this form would lead only
  to confusion, by rendering it difficult to make the distinction generally
  understood between architecture (<i>q.v.</i>) as a fine or liberal art,
  and architecture as a mechanical art. The execution of works of
  architecture necessarily includes building, but building is frequently
  employed when the result is not architectural; a man may be a competent
  builder without being an architect, but no one can be an accomplished
  architect unless he be competent to specify and direct all the operations
  of building. An architect should have a scientific knowledge of the
  various soils he may meet with, such as clay, earth, silt, rock, gravel,
  chalk, &amp;c., so that when the trial holes are dug out on the site, he
  can see the nature of the soil, and at once know what kind of a
  foundation to put to the building, and the depth to which he must go to
  get a good bottom. He should also have a good knowledge of chemistry, so
  that he may understand the effects of the various acids, gases, &amp;c.,
  that are contained in the materials he uses, and the objections to their
  presence. He must be acquainted with the principles of timbering in
  trenches, and excavations, shoring, brickwork, fireproof construction,
  stonework, carpentry and joinery, smiths' work, plumbing, heating,
  ventilation, bells, electric and gas lighting, water-supply, drainage,
  plastering, tiling to internal walls or pavings and roofs, slating of
  roofs, glazing, painting and decoration. He should be able to calculate
  the various strengths and strains to be placed on any portion of the
  structure, and have a general knowledge of the building trade, enabling
  him to deal with any difficulty or defects that may arise.</p>
      <p>An important feature in the qualification of the architect is that he
  should be thoroughly conversant with the by-laws of the different towns
  or districts, as to the requirements for the various classes of
  buildings, and the special features of portions of the different
  buildings. The following are examples of the various buildings which he
  may have to design, and the erection of which he may have to
  superintend:—dwelling-houses, domestic buildings, shops, dwellings
  for the working class, public buildings such as churches, schools,
  hospitals, libraries and hotels, factories of all kinds for all general
  trades, studios, electric power stations, cold storage buildings, stables
  and slaughterhouses. With regard to factories, places for the storage or
  making of different patent foods, and for slaughter of beasts intended
  for human consumption, stringent by-laws are in most countries laid down
  and enforced by the public health authorities. In England, the Public
  Health Acts and By-laws are carried out by the various borough or
  district authorities, who appoint inspectors especially to study the
  health of the public with regard to sanitary arrangements. The inspectors
  have special powers to deal with all improper or defective food, or with
  any defects in buildings that may affect its cleanly preparation.</p>
      <p>In addition to meeting the requirements of the clients, the various
  buildings have to be constructed and planned on clearly <ph outputclass="sidenote">Reasons for special type of plans.</ph> defined lines,
  according to the rules of the various authorities that control their
  erection; thus the construction and planning of public schools are
  governed in England by the board of education, and churches are governed
  by the various societies that assist in financing the erection of these
  edifices; of these the Incorporated Church Building Society exercises the
  strongest control. Factories both in England and France must be planned
  and erected to meet the separate acts that deal with these buildings. The
  fire insurance companies lay down certain requirements according to the
  size of the building, and the special trade for which it is erected, and
  fix their rate of premium accordingly. Dwelling-houses in London must be
  erected in accordance with the many building acts which govern the
  materials to be used, and the methods by which they shall be employed,
  the thickness of walls, rates of inclination of roofs, means of escape
  from fire, drainage, space at rear, &amp;c. &amp;c.; these laws
  especially forbid the use of timber framed buildings. In sundry districts
  in England where the model by-laws are not in force, notably at
  Letchworth, Herts, it is possible to erect buildings with sound materials
  untrammelled by by-laws. With regard to premises used in a combined way,
  as shop and dwelling-house, if in London, and the building exceeds 10
  squares, or 1000 sq. ft. super in area, the stairs and a large portion of
  the building must be built of fire-resisting materials. In the erection
  of London flats under certain conditions the stairs and corridors <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page763">[v.04
  p.0763]</ph>must be of fire-resisting materials, while in parts of New
  York timber buildings are allowed; for illustrations of these see the
  article <ph outputclass="sc">Carpentry</ph>. In public buildings and
  theatres in London, Paris and New York not only the construction, but
  also the exits and seating accommodation and stage, including the scenery
  dock and flies, must conform to certain regulations.</p>
      <p>The conditions necessary for planning a successful building may be
  summarized as follows:—(1) Ease of access; (2) Good <ph outputclass="sidenote">Conditions necessary for a successful building.</ph>
  light (3) Good service; (4) Pleasing environment and approaches; (5)
  Minimum cost with true economy; in the case of office buildings, also
  ease of rearrangement to suit tenants. An architect should also be
  practically acquainted with all the modes of operation in all the trades
  or arts employed in building, and be able minutely to estimate beforehand
  the absolute cost involved in the execution of a proposed structure. The
  power to do this necessarily involves that of measuring work (usually
  done by the quantity surveyor at an advanced stage of the work), and of
  ascertaining the quantities to be done. In ordinary practice the
  architect usually cubes a building at a price per foot cube, as will be
  described hereafter, but an architect should know how to measure and
  prepare quantities, or he cannot be said to be master of his
  profession.</p>
      <p>Building includes what is called construction, which is the branch of
  the science of architecture relating to the practical <ph outputclass="sidenote">Construction.</ph> execution of the works required to
  produce any structure; it will therefore be necessary to explain the
  subject in a general manner before entering upon building in detail.</p>
      <p>Although the styles of architecture have varied at different periods,
  buildings, wherever similar materials are employed, must be constructed
  on much the same principles. Scientific knowledge of the natures and
  properties of materials has, however, given to the modern workman immense
  advantages over his medieval brother-craftsman, and caused many changes
  in the details of the trade, or art of building, although stones, bricks,
  mortar, &amp;c., then as now, formed the element of the more solid parts
  of all edifices.</p>
      <p>The object of constructions is to adapt, combine and fit materials in
  such a manner that they shall retain in use the <ph outputclass="sidenote">General principles.</ph> forms and dispositions
  assigned to them. If an upright wall be properly constructed upon a
  sufficient foundation, the combined mass will retain its position and
  bear pressure acting in the direction of gravity to any extent that the
  ground on which it stands, and the compound materials of the wall, can
  sustain. But pressure acting laterally has a necessary tendency to
  overthrow a wall, and therefore it will be the aim of the constructor to
  compel, as far as possible, all forces that can act upon an upright wall,
  to act in the direction of gravity, or else to give it permanent means of
  resistance in the direction opposite to that in which a disturbing force
  may act. Thus when an arch is built to bear against an upright wall, a
  buttress or other counterfort is applied in a direction opposed to the
  pressure of the arch. In like manner the inclined roof of a building
  spanning from wall to wall tends to thrust out the walls, and hence a tie
  is applied to hold the opposite sides of the roof together at its base,
  where alone a tie can be fully efficient, and thus the roof is made to
  act upon the walls wholly in the direction of gravity; or where an
  efficient tie is inapplicable, as in the case of a hammer beam roof,
  buttresses or counterforts are added to the walls, to enable them to
  resist the pressure outwards. A beam laid horizontally from wall to wall,
  as a girder to carry a floor and its load, may sag or bend downwards, and
  tend thereby to force out the walls, or the beam itself may break. Both
  these contingencies are obviated by trussing, which renders the beam
  stiff enough to place its load on the walls in the direction of gravity,
  and strong enough to carry it safely. Or if the beam be rigid in its
  nature, or uncertain in its structure, or both (as cast-iron is), and
  will break without bending, the constructor by the smiths' art will
  supply a check and ensure it against the possible contingency.</p>
      <p>Perfect stability, however, is not to be obtained with materials which
  are subject to influences beyond the control of man, and all matter is
  subject to certain influences of that nature. The <ph outputclass="sidenote">Materials.</ph> influences mostly to be contended
  against are heat and humidity, the former of which produces movement of
  some kind or to some extent in all bodies, the latter, in many kinds of
  matter; whilst the two acting together contribute to the disintegration
  or decay of materials available for the purposes of construction. These
  pervading influences the constructor seeks to counteract, by proper
  selection and disposition of his materials.</p>
      <p>Stone and brick, the principal materials in general construction, keep
  their places in combination by means of gravity. They may <ph outputclass="sidenote">Stone.</ph> be merely packed together, but in general
  they are compacted by means of mortar or cement, so that although the
  main constituent materials are wholly incompressible, masses of either,
  or of both, combined in structures are compressible, until the setting
  medium has indurated to a like condition of hardness. That kind of stone
  is best fitted for the purposes of general construction which is least
  absorbent of moisture, and at the same time free to work. Absorbent stone
  exposed to the weather rapidly disintegrates, and for the most part
  non-absorbent stone is so hard that it cannot always be used with a due
  regard to economy. When, therefore, suitable stone of both qualities can
  be obtained, the harder stone can be exposed to the weather, or to the
  action which the softer stone cannot resist, and made to form the main
  body of the structure of the latter so protected. The hard and the soft
  should be made to bear alike, and should therefore be coursed and bonded
  together by the mason's art, whether the work be of stone wrought into
  blocks and gauged to thickness, or of rough dressed or otherwise unshaped
  rubble compacted with mortar.</p>
      <p>Good bricks are less absorbent of moisture than any stone of the same
  degree of hardness, and are better non-conductors <ph outputclass="sidenote">Bricks.</ph> of heat than stone. As the basis of a
  stable structure, brickwork is more to be relied upon than stone in the
  form of rubble, when the constituents bear the relation to one another
  last above referred to, the setting material being the same in both;
  because the brick by its shaped form seats itself truly, and produces by
  bonding a more perfectly combined mass, whilst the imperfectly shaped and
  variously sized stone as dressed rubble can neither bed nor bond truly,
  the inequalities of the form having to be compensated for with mortar,
  and the irregularity of size of the main constituent accounted for by the
  introduction of larger and smaller stones. The most perfect stability is
  to be obtained, nevertheless, from truly wrought and accurately seated
  and bonded blocks of stone, mortar being used to no greater extent than
  may be necessary to exclude wind and water and prevent the disintegrating
  action of these agents upon even the most durable stone. When water alone
  is to be dealt with, and especially when it is liable to act with force,
  mortar is necessary for securing to every block in the structure its own
  full weight, and the aid of every other collateral and superimposed
  stone, in order to resist the loosening effect which water in powerful
  action is bound to produce.</p>
      <p>In the application of construction to any particular object, the
  nature of the object will naturally affect the character of <ph outputclass="sidenote">Particular objects of construction.</ph> the
  constructions and the materials of which they are to be formed. Every
  piece of construction should be complete in itself, and independent as
  such of everything beyond it. A door or a gate serves its purpose by an
  application wholly foreign to itself, but it is a good and effective, or
  a bad and ineffective, piece of construction, independently of the posts
  to which it may be hung, whilst the wheel of a wheelbarrow, comprising
  felloes, spokes and axletree, is a piece of construction complete in
  itself, and independent as such of everything beyond it. An arch of
  masonry, however large it may be, is not necessarily a piece of
  construction complete in itself, for it would fall to pieces without
  abutments. Thus a bridge consisting of a series of arches, however
  extensive, may be but one piece of construction, no arch being complete
  in itself without the collateral arches in the series to serve as its
  abutments, and the whole series being dependent thereby upon <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page764">[v.04
  p.0764]</ph>the ultimate abutments of the bridge, without which the
  structure would not stand. This illustration is not intended to apply to
  the older bridges with widely distended masses, which render each pier
  sufficient to abut the arches springing from it, but tend, in providing
  for a way over the river, to choke up the way by the river itself, or to
  compel the river either to throw down the structure or else to destroy
  its own banks.</p>
      <p>Some soils are liable to change in form, expanding and contracting
  under meteorological influences; such are clays which <ph outputclass="sidenote">Foundations.</ph> swell when wetted and shrink when
  dried. Concrete foundations are commonly interposed upon such soils to
  protect the building from derangement from this cause; or walls of the
  cheaper material, concrete, instead of the more expensive brick or stone
  structure, are brought up from a level sufficiently below the ordinary
  surface of the ground. When concrete is used to obviate the tendency of
  the soil to yield to pressure, expanse or extent of base is required, and
  the concrete being widely spread should therefore be deep or thick as a
  layer, only with reference to its own power of transmitting to the ground
  the weight of the wall to be built upon it, without breaking across or
  being crushed. But when concrete is used as a substitute for a wall, in
  carrying a wall down to a low level, it is in fact a wall in itself, wide
  only in proportion to its comparative weakness in the absence of
  manipulated bond in its construction, and encased by the soil within
  which it is placed. When a concrete wall is used in place of brick the
  London Building Act requires an extra thickness of one-third; on the
  question of reinforced concrete no regulations as to thickness have at
  present been made.</p>
      <p>The foundation of a building of ordinary weight is for the most part
  sufficiently provided for by applying what are technically <ph outputclass="sidenote">Footings to walls.</ph> termed "footings" to the
  walls. The reason for a footing is, that the wall obtains thereby a
  bearing upon a breadth of ground so much greater than its own width or
  thickness above the footing as to compensate for the difference between
  the power of resisting pressure of the wall, and of the ground or
  ultimate foundation upon which the wall is to rest. It will be clear from
  this that if a building is to be erected upon rock as hard as the main
  constituent of the walls theoretically no expanded footings will be
  necessary; if upon chalk, upon strong or upon weak gravel, upon sand or
  upon clay, the footing must be expanded with reference to the power of
  resistance of the structure to be used as a foundation; whilst in or upon
  made ground or other loose and badly combined or imperfectly resisting
  soil, a solid platform bearing evenly over the ground, and wide enough
  not to sink into it, becomes necessary under the constructed footing. For
  this purpose the easiest, the most familiar, and for most purposes the
  most effectual and durable is a layer of concrete.</p>
      <p>The English government, when it has legislated upon building matters,
  has generally confined itself to making provision that the enclosing
  walls of buildings should be formed of incombustible materials. In
  provisions regarding the least thicknesses of such walls, these were
  generally determined with reference to the height and length of the
  building.</p>
      <p>In the general and usual practice of developing land at the present
  day, the owner or freeholder of the land first consults an <ph outputclass="sidenote">Procedure for an intended building.</ph> architect and
  states his intentions of building, the size of what he requires, what it
  is to be used for, if for trade how many hands he intends to employ, and
  the sub-buildings and departments, &amp;c., that will be wanted. The
  architect gathers as much information as he can as to his client's
  requirements, and from this information prepares his sketches. This first
  step is usually done with rough sketches or outlines only, and when
  approved by the client as regards the planning and situation of rooms,
  &amp;c., the architect prepares the plans, elevations, and sections on
  the lines of the approved rough sketches; at the same time he strictly
  observes the building acts, and makes every portion of the building
  comply with these acts as regards the thickness of walls, open spaces,
  light and air, distances from surrounding property, frontage lines, and a
  host of other points too numerous to mention, as far as he can interpret
  the meaning of the enactments. (The London and New York Building Acts are
  very extensive, with numerous amendments made as occasion requires.) An
  architect, whilst preparing the working drawings from the rough approved
  sketches, and endeavouring to conform with the Building Act requirements,
  often finds after consultation with the district surveyor, or the London
  County Council, or other local authorities, that the plans have to be
  altered; and when so altered the client may disapprove of them, and thus
  delay often occurs in settling them.</p>
      <p>Another important point is that after the architect has obtained the
  consent of the building authorities, and also the approval of the client,
  then he may have to fight the adjoining owners with regard to ancient
  lights, or air space, or party walls. In the city of London these last
  difficulties often mean the suspension of the work for a long time, and a
  great loss to the client.</p>
      <p>If the site is a large one, or the nature of the soil uncertain, trial
  holes should be sunk directly the sketch plans are approved. (See <ph outputclass="sc">Foundations</ph>.)</p>
      <p>Where the property is leasehold there are always at this stage
  negotiations as to obtaining the approval of the senior lessors and the
  freeholders; these having been obtained, the architect is then free to
  serve the various notices that may be required <i>re</i> party walls,
  &amp;c.</p>
      <p>The contract plans should be very carefully prepared, and sections,
  plans and elevations of all parts of the buildings and the levels from a
  datum line be given. In addition to the general set of drawings, larger
  scale details of the principal portions of the building should be
  given.</p>
      <p>If there are any existing buildings on the site these should be
  carefully surveyed and accurate detail plans be made for reference; this
  is especially necessary with regard to easements and rights of adjoining
  owners. Also in the preparation of the site plan the various levels of
  the ground should be shown.</p>
      <p>The plans having been approved by all parties concerned, the next
  operation is the preparation of the <i>specification</i>. This is a
  document which describes the materials to be used in the building, states
  how they are to be mixed, and how the various works are to be executed,
  and specifies every trade, and every portion of work in the building. The
  specification is necessary to enable the builder to erect the structure
  according to the architect's requirements, and is written by the
  architect; usually two copies of this document are made, one for the
  builder, the other for the architect, and the latter is signed as the
  contract copy in the same manner as the drawings.</p>
      <p>From the specification and drawings usually an approximate estimate of
  the cost of the proposed building is prepared by the architect, and the
  most general method adopted is to cube the building by a multiplication
  of the length, breadth and height of the building, and to multiply the
  product or cubic contents by a price ranging from fivepence to three
  shillings per cubic foot. In the case of churches, chapels and schools,
  the cost may be roughly computed by taking the number of seats at a price
  per seat. In the case of churches and chapels, taking a minimum area of 8
  ft. each, the cost varies from £10 upwards, the difference being due to
  the amount of architectural embellishment or the addition of a tower.
  Schools may be estimated as averaging £9 per scholar; we find that,
  taking schools of various sizes erected by the late London School Board,
  their cost varied from £7:12:4 to £10:1:10 per scholar. Hospitals vary
  from £100 per bed upwards, the lowest cost being taken from a cottage
  hospital type; while in the case of St Thomas's hospital, London, the
  cost per bed, including the proportion of the administrative block, was
  £650, and without this portion the wards alone cost £250. The Herbert
  hospital at Woolwich cost only £320 per bed.</p>
      <p>The bills of quantities are prepared by the quantity surveyor, and are
  generally made to form part of the contract, and so mentioned in "the
  contract." The work of the quantity surveyor is to measure from the
  drawings the whole of the materials required for the structure, and state
  the amounts or quantities of the respective materials in the form of a
  bill usually made out on foolscap paper specially ruled, so that <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page765">[v.04
  p.0765]</ph>the builders can price each item, together with the labour
  required to work and fix it, thus forming the building. The idea is to be
  able to arrive at a lump sum for which the builders will undertake to
  erect the building. It is of frequent occurrence, in fact it occurs in
  four-fifths of building contracts, that when a building is commenced, the
  client, or other interested person, will alter some portion, thereby
  causing deviations from the bills of quantities. By having the prices of
  the different materials before him, it is easy for the quantity surveyor
  to remeasure the portion altered, adding or deducting as the case may be,
  and thus to ascertain what difference the alteration makes. This method
  of bills of quantities and prices is absolutely necessary to any one
  about to build, and means a considerable saving to the client in the end.
  For example:—Suppose that bills of quantities are not prepared for
  a certain job by a quantity surveyor, and, as is often done, the drawings
  and specification are sent to several builders asking them for a
  quotation to build the house or factory or whatever it may be, according
  to the drawings and specification. The prices are duly sent in to the
  architect, and probably the lowest price is accepted and the successful
  builder starts the job. During the progress of the works certain
  alterations take place by the owner's instructions, and when the day of
  settlement comes, the builder puts in his claim for "extras," then owing
  to the alterations and to the architect having no prices to work upon,
  litigation often ensues.</p>
      <p>Before the work of erecting a structure is entrusted to a builder he
  has to sign a contract in the same manner as the drawings and
  specification. This contract is an important document wherein the builder
  agrees to carry out the work for a stated sum of money, in accordance
  with the drawings and specification, and bills of quantities, and
  instructions of the architect, and to his entire satisfaction; and it
  also states the description of the materials and workmanship, and the
  manner of carrying out the work, responsibilities of the builder,
  particularly clauses indemnifying the employer against accidents to
  employees, and against numerous other risks, the time of completion of
  works under a penalty for non-completion (the usual allowance being made
  for bad weather, fire or strikes), and also how payments will be made to
  the builder as he proceeds with the building. This form of contract is
  generally prepared by the architect, and varies in part as may be
  necessary to meet the requirements of the case.</p>
      <p>When the drawings have been approved by the owner or client, also by
  the district surveyor or local authorities, and by adjoining owners, one
  copy of them, made on linen, is usually deposited (in London) either with
  the district surveyor, or with the London County Council, another is
  prepared for the freeholder if a lease of the land is granted, and a
  third is given to the builder. In addition, in complicated cases such as
  occur in the city of London, when a building is erected on land which has
  four or five distinct owners, an architect may have to prepare a large
  number of complete copies to be deposited with the various parties
  interested.</p>
      <p>The duties of the builder are very similar to those of the architect,
  except that he is not expected to be able to plan <ph outputclass="sidenote">The builder's sphere.</ph> and design, but to carry
  out the plans and designs of the architect in the actual work of
  building. The builder should also know the various acts, and in
  particular the acts specially relating to the erection of scaffoldings,
  hoardings, gantries, shoring and pulling down of old buildings. He should
  have a thorough knowledge of all materials, their qualifying marks or
  brands, and the special features of good and bad in each class, their
  uses and method of use. He should be able to control and manage both the
  men and materials; and briefly, in a builder, as opposed to an architect,
  the constructive knowledge should predominate.</p>
      <p>On large or important works it is usual to have a clerk of works or
  delegate from the architect; his duties are to be on the works while they
  are in progress and endeavour by constant attention to secure the use of
  the best materials and construction, and to report to the architect for
  his instruction any difficulties that may arise. He should be a
  thoroughly practical man as opposed to the architectural draughtsman. His
  salary is paid by the client, and is not included in the architect's
  remuneration.</p>
      <p>American building acts agree in a general manner with those enforced
  in London. But whereas New York allows the erection <ph outputclass="sidenote">American practice.</ph> of frame or wood structures,
  while defining a certain portion of the city inside which no new frame or
  wood structures shall be erected, in London and the large cities of Great
  Britain the erection of wood frame buildings as dwellings is prohibited.
  In New York City provision is made for a space at the rear of domestic
  buildings at least 10 ft. deep, but such depth is increased when the
  building is over 60 ft. high, and is varied under special circumstances.
  In London this depth is the same, but the height of the building in
  relation to the space required in the rear thereof shall be constructed
  to keep within an angle of 63½ degrees, inclining from the rear boundary
  towards the building from the level of pavement in front of building; the
  position from which the angle is taken is varied under special
  circumstances. In the smaller English towns the building regulations are
  framed on the model by-laws, and these increase the depth of the yard or
  garden according to the height of the building.</p>
      <p>With regard to the strength and proportion of materials, these are not
  dealt with in the London Building Act to the same extent as in the New
  York; for example, in the New York acts (parts 4 and 5)<xref href="#d1e33952/Footnote_362" type="fn"><!--[2]--></xref> it is
  prescribed that the bricks used shall be good, hard, well-burned bricks.
  The sand used for mortar shall be clean, sharp, grit sand, free from loam
  or dirt, and shall not be finer than the standard samples kept in the
  office of the department of buildings; also the quality of lime and
  mortar is fully described, and the strengths of steel and cast-iron, and
  tests of new materials. Also it is required that all excavations for
  buildings shall be properly guarded and protected so as to prevent them
  from becoming dangerous to life or limb, and shall be sheath-piled where
  necessary by the person or persons causing the excavations to be made, to
  prevent the adjoining earth from caving in. Plans filed in the department
  of buildings shall be accompanied by a statement of the character of the
  soil at the level of the footings. There are also requirements as to
  protecting adjoining property. The bearing capacity of soils, pressure
  under footings of foundations, and in part 6 the materials of walls and
  the methods to be observed in building them are defined. Part 23 deals
  with floor loads, and the strength of floors constructed of various
  materials, and requires that the temporary support shall be strong enough
  to carry the load placed upon them during the progress of any works to
  buildings. Part 24 deals with the calculations and strength of materials,
  and wind pressure. Parts 4 and 5 of the New York Building Code are not
  dealt with by the London Building Act, but the local by-laws of the
  various districts deal with these. Part 6 of the New York code is dealt
  with partly by the London Building Act, and partly by the local by-laws.
  Parts 23 and 24 of the New York code are not dealt with in the English
  acts at all. In America the standard quality for all materials is set
  out, but in no English acts do we find the definition of the quality of
  timber, new materials, steel, &amp;c. Iron and steel construction is in
  its infancy in England as compared with America, and probably this
  accounts for no special regulations being in force; but part 22 of the
  New York Building Code, section 110 to 129 inclusive, deals very fully
  with iron and steel construction, and this is further supplemented by
  sections 137 to 140 inclusive.</p>
      <p>Sanitary work is dealt with in London by section 39 of the Public
  Health (London) Act, and the drainage by-laws of the London County
  Council, in which every detail is very fully gone into with regard to the
  laying of drains, and fitting up of soil pipes, w.c.'s, &amp;c., all of
  which is to be carried out and tested to the satisfaction of the local
  borough's sanitary inspector. The general requirements of New York with
  regard to sanitary work are very similar with a few more restrictions,
  and are carried out under "the rules and regulations for plumbing,
  drainage, <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page766">[v.04 p.0766]</ph>water-supply, and ventilation of
  buildings." The noticeable feature of the New York regulations is that
  all master plumbers have to be registered, which is not so in England.
  The New York regulations have 183 sections relating to sanitary work, and
  the English regulations have 96 sections. Also by part 16 of the
  Amendments to Plumbing Rules 1903, the New York laws require that, before
  any construction of, or alterations to, any gas piping or fittings are
  commenced, permits must be obtained from the superintendent of buildings;
  these are only issued to a registered plumber. The application must be
  accompanied by plans of the different floors showing each outlet, and the
  number of burners to each outlet; a statement must also be made of the
  quality of the pipes and fittings, all of which are to be tested by the
  inspector. In London there are no such laws; the gas companies control a
  small portion of the work as regards the connexion to meters, while the
  insurance companies require gas jets to be covered with a wire guard
  where liable to come in contact with inflammable goods. As to water, the
  various water companies in England have each their own set of regulations
  as to the kind of fittings and thickness and quality of pipe to be used,
  whether for service, wastes or main.</p>
      <p>The importance of fire-resisting construction is being more fully
  recognized now by all countries. In France the regulations <ph outputclass="sidenote">Fire-resisting construction.</ph> for factories, shops
  and workshops relating to "exits" require that all doors should open
  outwardly when they open on to courts, vestibules, staircases or interior
  passages. When they give access to the open air, outward opening is not
  obligatory unless it has been judged necessary in the interests of
  safety. If the doors open on to a passage or staircase they must be fixed
  in such a manner as not to project into the passage or staircase when
  open. The exits must be numerous, and signs indicating the quickest way
  out are to be placed in conspicuous positions. The windows are to open
  outwardly. Staircases in offices or other buildings serving as places for
  work shall be constructed in incombustible materials, or shall be walled
  in fully in plaster. The number of staircases shall be in proportion to
  the number of employees, &amp;c. It is prohibited to use any liquid
  emitting vapours inflammable under 35° C. for the purpose of lighting or
  heating, unless the apparatus containing the liquid is solidly closed
  during work, that part of the apparatus containing the liquid being so
  closed as to avoid any oozing out of the liquid, &amp;c. &amp;c.
  Instructions are added as to precautions to be taken in case of fire.</p>
      <p>In London fire-resisting construction is dealt with in the London
  Building Act, and its second schedule, and in London County Council
  Theatre and Factory Acts, &amp;c. In New York the building code (parts
  19, 20 and 21) deals with fire appliances, escapes, and fire-proof
  shutters and doors, fire-proof buildings and fire-proof floors, and
  requires that all tenement houses shall have an iron ladder for escape. A
  section somewhat similar to the last came into force in London in 1907
  under the London Building Act, being framed with a view to require all
  existing projecting one-storey shops to have a fire-resisting roof, and
  all existing buildings over 50 ft. in height to have means of escape to
  and from the roof in case of fire.</p>
      <p>There are several patents now in use with which it would be possible
  to erect a fire-proof dwelling at small cost with walls 3 to 5 in. in
  thickness. One of these has been used where the building act does not
  apply, as in the case of the Newgate prison cells, London, where the
  outside walls were from 3 to 4 in. thick only, and were absolutely fire
  and burglar proof. This method consists in using steel dovetailed sheets
  fixed between small steel stanchions and plastered in cement on both
  sides. This form of construction was also used at the British pavilion,
  Paris Exhibition 1900, and has been employed in numerous other buildings
  in England, and also in South Africa, Venezuela, and India (Delhi
  durbar). The use of many of these convenient and sound forms of building
  construction for ordinary buildings in London, and in districts of
  England where the model by-laws are in force, is prohibited because they
  do not comply with some one or other of the various clauses relating to
  materials, or to the thickness of a wall.</p>

         <fn id="Footnote_361"> The verb "to
  build" (O.E. <i>byldan</i>) is apparently connected with O.E.
  <i>bold</i>, a dwelling, of Scandinavian origin; cf. Danish <i>bol</i>, a
  farm, Icelandic <i>ból</i>, farm, abode. Skeat traces it eventually to
  Sanskrit <i>bhu</i>, to be, build meaning "to construct a place in which
  to be or dwell."</fn>
