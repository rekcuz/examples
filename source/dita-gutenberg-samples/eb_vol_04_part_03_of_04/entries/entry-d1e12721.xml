   <body>
      <p><!--BRISSON, MATHURIN JACQUES--> (1723-1806), French zoologist and
  natural philosopher, was born at Fontenay le Comte on the 30th of April
  1723. The earlier part of his life was spent in the pursuit of natural
  history, his published works in this department including <i>Le Règne
  animal</i> (1756) and <i>Ornithologie</i> (1760). After the death of
  R.A.F. Réaumur (1683-1757), whose assistant he was, he abandoned natural
  history, and was appointed professor of natural philosophy at Navarre and
  later at Paris. His most important work in this department was his
  <i>Poids spécifiques des corps</i> (1787), but he published several other
  books on physical subjects which were in considerable repute for a time.
  He died at Croissy near Paris, on the 23rd of June 1806.</p>
