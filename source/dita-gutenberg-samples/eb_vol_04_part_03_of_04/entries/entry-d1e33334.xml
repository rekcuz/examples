   <title>BUG</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUG,--> the common name for hemipterous insects of the family
  <i>Cimicidae</i>, of which the best-known example is the house bug or bed
  bug (<i>Cimex lectularius</i>). This disgusting insect is of an oval
  shape, of a rusty red colour, and, in common with the whole tribe to
  which it belongs, gives off an offensive odour when touched; unlike the
  others, however, it is wingless. The bug is provided with a proboscis,
  which when at rest lies along the inferior side of the thorax, and
  through which it sucks the blood of man, the sole food of this species.
  It is nocturnal in its habits, remaining concealed by day in crevices of
  bed furniture, among the hangings, or behind the wall paper, and shows
  considerable activity in its nightly raids in search of food. The female
  deposits her eggs at the beginning of summer in crevices of wood and
  other retired situations, and in three weeks the young emerge as small,
  white, and almost transparent larvae. These change their skin very
  frequently during growth, and attain full development in about eleven
  weeks. Two centuries ago the bed bug was a rare insect in Britain, and
  probably owes its name, which is derived from a Celtic word signifying
  "ghost" or "goblin," to the terror which its attacks at first inspired.
  An allied species, the dove-cote bug (<i>Cimex columbaria</i>), attacks
  domestic fowls and pigeons.</p>
