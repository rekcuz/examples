   <title>BRYOPHYTA</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRYOPHYTA,--> the botanical name of the second great subdivision
  of the vegetable kingdom, which includes the mosses and liverworts. They
  are all plants of small, often minute, size, and, as the absence of
  popular names indicates, the different kinds are not commonly recognized.
  Even the distinction between liverworts and mosses is not clearly made,
  not only the former but other small plants of higher groups being
  popularly called mosses. A little careful observation soon shows,
  however, that the Bryophytes form a well-defined class, including several
  subordinate groups. Though their study necessarily involves minute
  observation they possess many features of interest. The adaptations they
  show to their conditions of life are often very perfect and present
  interesting analogies with the adaptive characters of the higher plants.
  They are of great scientific interest not only as representing a special
  type of life-history and organization, but because in several of the
  subordinate groups series of forms can be traced, which enable the
  general course of their evolution to be inferred even in the practical
  absence of fossil remains of any antiquity.</p>
      <p>Bryophytes are very generally distributed over the earth, and those of
  a single country, such as Britain, afford examples of all the chief
  natural groups. Sometimes, as is the case with the bog-mosses and some
  arctic mosses, they may cover considerable tracts. As a rule, however,
  they occupy a subordinate place in the vegetation, and the different
  kinds require to be carefully looked for. Covering, as they often do,
  what would otherwise be bare ground, they are of value in assisting to
  retain moisture in the soil and in preparing the way for its colonization
  by higher plants. Although many forms are capable of withstanding periods
  of drought they succeed best in relatively moist climates and localities.
  This is shown both by their unequal abundance in different localities of
  one country and in their scarcity in certain geographical regions as
  compared with their luxuriance in others.</p>
      <p>The external appearance and general organization show great variety.
  In all mosses and many liverworts (figs. 8, 11) the plant consists of a
  stem bearing small leaves. In a number of liverworts (figs. 2, 7), on the
  other hand, it presents no distinction of stem and leaf, but is a flat,
  dorsiventral body usually closely applied to the substratum on which it
  grows. This, in contradistinction to the leafy shoot, is termed a
  <i>thallus</i>. True roots are never present, the plants being attached
  to the soil by <i>rhizoids</i>, which resemble the root-hairs of higher
  plants.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The reproductive organs borne by the thallus or plant are called
  antheridia and archegonia, and serve for sexual reproduction. The
  <i>antheridium</i> (figs. 5, 15) has a longer or shorter stalk and
  consists of a wall formed of a single layer of flat cells enclosing a
  mass of minute cells from which the spermatozoids are developed. In the
  cases which have been most carefully investigated two spermatozoids have
  been found to arise from each of the small cubical cells of the central
  tissue. When mature the antheridium opens on being moistened and the
  spermatozoids become free in the water by the dissolution of the
  mucilaginous cell-walls enclosing them. Each has the form (fig. 5, D) of
  a more or less spirally twisted, club-shaped body, bearing at the pointed
  anterior end two long cilia by means of which it moves through the water.
  The <i>archegonium</i> (fig. 1) has the form of a narrow flask with a
  long neck. It usually has a short stalk and consists of a central row of
  cells enclosed by a layer of cells forming the wall. The egg-cell or ovum
  lies within the wider basal region or venter, and above it come the
  ventral canal-cell and canal-cells within the neck of the archegonium.
  When the archegonium opens by the separation of the cells at the tip, the
  disorganized canal-cells escape, leaving a narrow tubular passage leading
  down to the ovum. Each antheridium or archegonium arises from a single
  cell, and while the mature structure is similar in the two groups, the
  development presents differences in liverworts and mosses. Without
  entering into details it may be mentioned that in the mosses it proceeds
  both in the archegonium and antheridium by the segmentation of an apical
  cell, while this is not the case in the liverworts. Fertilization is
  effected by the passage of a spermatozoid, attracted probably by means of
  a chemical stimulus, down the passage of the archegonial neck and its
  fusion with the ovum. It thus, as in other cases of sexual reproduction,
  involves the union of <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page701">[v.04 p.0701]</ph>two cells, and the vegetative
  plant, since it bears the sexual organs, is called the sexual generation
  or <i>gametophyte</i>.</p>
      <p>From the fertilized ovum another and very different stage arises,
  which remains attached to the sexual plant and has thus the appearance of
  a fruit borne on it. It consists of a capsule usually borne on a longer
  or shorter stalk or seta, the base of which is inserted into the tissues
  of the gametophyte. This basal region, which serves to absorb
  nourishment, is called the foot. Within the capsule numerous reproductive
  cells, the spores, are developed. In contrast to the sexual generation
  this stage is called the spore-bearing generation (<i>sporogonium</i>,
  <i>sporophyte</i>). The examination of any moss "in fruit" (fig. 11, B)
  will show the readily detachable sporogonium borne on the leafy sexual
  plant, and the relation existing between the two generations will be
  evident from figs. 2, 3, 9, and 16. In liverworts (with one or two
  exceptions) the mature capsule is filled with spores mingled with sterile
  cells or elaters and opens by splitting into valves. In mosses (fig. 11,
  C) the sporogonium is more highly organized; a central column of sterile
  tissue (the columella) is found in the capsule, which opens by the
  removal of a lid or operculum, and there are no elaters among the spores.
  By the opening of the capsule the spores are set free, and under suitable
  conditions germinate and give rise to the sexual generation. In mosses
  (fig. 12) a filamentous growth, the protonema, is first formed, and the
  leafy plants arise upon this. In liverworts this preliminary phase of the
  sexual generation is as a rule ill-marked or absent, and the plant may be
  said to develop directly from the spore.</p>
      <p>It will be evident that the two generations exhibit a regular
  succession or alternation in the life-history of all Bryophytes. The
  gametophyte is developed from the spore and bears the sexual organs; the
  sporogonium is developed from the fertilized egg and produces spores. An
  important cytological difference between the two generations can only be
  mentioned here. By the union of the nuclei of the spermatozoid and ovum
  in fertilization the number of chromosomes in the resulting nucleus is
  doubled, and this double number is maintained throughout all the
  cell-divisions of the sporogonium. On the development of the spores,
  which takes place by the division of each spore-mother-cell into four,
  the number of chromosomes becomes one half of what it has been in all the
  nuclei of the sporogonium. This reduced number is maintained throughout
  the development of the sexual generation. Thus in <i>Pellia</i> the
  nuclei of the gametophyte have eight chromosomes and those of the
  sporophyte sixteen. The relation in which the two generations stand to
  one another is the most important common characteristic of the Bryophyta.
  The gametophyte is always the independently living individual upon which
  the spore-bearing generation is throughout its life dependent. In all
  plants higher than the Bryophyta the sporophyte becomes an independently
  rooted plant and is the conspicuous stage in the life-history. Thus in
  the fern the sexual generation is the small prothallus developed from the
  spore, while the familiar fern-plant is the spore-bearing generation (see
  <ph outputclass="sc">Pteridophyta</ph>). On the other hand a corresponding
  alternation of generations is only indicated in the lower plants
  (Thallophyta).</p>
      <p>The Bryophyta are divided into the Hepaticae (liverworts) and Musci
  (mosses). In the Hepaticae we can recognize three subordinate
  groups—the Marchantiales, Jungermanniales and Anthocerotales; and
  in the Musci also three groups—the Sphagnales, Andreaeales and
  Bryales. Since these series of forms differ considerably among
  themselves, it is difficult to express in a definition the distinction
  between a liverwort and a moss which is readily made in practice. We may
  therefore leave it to the description of the several groups of Hepaticae
  and Musci to supplement the differences mentioned above and to bring out
  the exceptions which exist.</p>
      <section>
         <title>Hepaticae (Liverworts).</title>
         <p>The range of form and structure of both generations in the liverworts
  is so great that no one form can be taken as a satisfactory type. It
  will, however, be of use to preface the more general description by a
  brief account of a particular example, and we may take for this purpose a
  very common and easily recognized thalloid liverwort belonging to the
  Jungermanniales.</p>

            <i>Pellia epiphylla</i> (fig. 2) can be found at any season growing in
  large patches on the damp soil of woods, banks, &amp;c. The broad flat
  thallus is green and may be a couple of inches long. It is sparingly
  branched, the branching being apparently dichotomous; the growing point
  is situated in a depression at the anterior end of each branch. The
  wing-like lateral portions of the thallus gradually thin out from the
  midrib; from the projecting lower surface of this numerous rhizoids
  spring. These are elongated superficial cells, and serve to fix the
  thallus to the soil and obtain water and salts from it. No leaf-like
  appendages are borne on the thallus, but short glandular hairs occur
  behind the apex. The plant is composed throughout of very similar living
  cells, the more superficial ones containing numerous chlorophyll grains,
  while starch is stored in the internal cells of the midrib. The cells
  contain a number of oil-bodies the function of which is imperfectly
  understood. The growth of the thallus proceeds by the regular
  segmentation of a single apical cell. The sexual organs are borne on the
  upper surface, and both antheridia and archegonia occur on the same
  branch (fig. 3, A). The antheridia (<i>an</i>) are scattered over the
  middle region of the thallus, and each is surrounded by a tubular
  upgrowth from the surface. The archegonia (<i>ar</i>) are developed in a
  group behind the apex, and the latter continues to grow for a time after
  their formation, so that they come to be seated in a depression of the
  upper surface. They are further protected by the growth of the hinder
  margin of the depression to form a scale-like involucre (<i>in</i>).
  Fertilization takes place about June, and the sporogonium is fully
  developed by the winter. The embryo developed from the fertilized ovum
  consists at first of a number of tiers of cells. Its terminal tier gives
  rise to the capsule, the first divisions in the four cells of the tier
  marking off the wall of the capsule from the cells destined to produce
  the spores. In fig. 4, C, which represents a longitudinal section of a
  young embryo of <i>Pellia</i>, these archesporial cells are shaded. The
  tiers below give rise to the seta and foot. The mature sporogonium (fig.
  3, B) consists of the foot embedded in the tissue of the thallus, the
  seta, which remains short until just before the shedding of the spores,
  and the spherical capsule. It remains for long enclosed within the
  calyptra formed by the further development of the archegonial wall and
  surmounted by the neck of the archegonium. The calyptra is ultimately
  burst through, and in early spring the seta elongates rapidly, raising
  the dark-coloured capsule (fig. 2). In the young condition the wall of
  the capsule, which consists of two layers of cells, encloses a mass of
  similar cells developed from the archesporium. Some of these become
  spore-mother-cells and give rise by cell division to four spores, while
  others remain undivided and become the elaters. The latter are elongated
  spindle-shaped cells with thick brown spiral bands on the inside of their
  thin walls. They radiate out from a small plug of sterile cells
  projecting into the base of the capsule, and some are attached to this,
  while others lie free among the spores. The latter are large, and at
  first are unicellular; but in <i>Pellia</i>, which in this respect is
  exceptional, they commence their further development within the capsule,
  and thus consist of several cells when shed. <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page702">[v.04 p.0702]</ph>The cells of
  the capsule wall have incomplete, brown, thickened rings on their walls,
  and the capsule opens by splitting into four valves, which bend away from
  one another, allowing the loose spores to be readily dispersed by the
  wind, assisted by the hygroscopic movements of the elaters. On falling
  upon damp soil the spores germinate, growing into a thallus, which
  gradually attains its full size and bears sexual organs.</p>

         <p>While the general course of the life-history of all liverworts
  resembles that of <i>Pellia</i>, the three great groups into which they
  are divided differ from one another in the characters of both
  generations. Each group exhibits a series leading from more simple to
  more highly organized forms, and the differentiation has proceeded on
  distinct and to some extent divergent lines in the three groups. The
  Marchantiales are a series of thalloid forms, in which the structure of
  the thallus is specialized to enable them to live in more exposed
  situations. The lowest members of the series (<i>Riccia</i>) possess the
  simplest sporogonia known, consisting of a wall of one layer of cells
  enclosing the spores. In the higher forms a sterile foot and seta is
  present, and sterile cells or elaters occur with the spores. The lower
  members of the Jungermanniales are also thalloid, but the thallus never
  has the complicated structure characteristic of the Marchantiales, and
  progress is in the direction of the differentiation of the plant into
  stem and leaf. Indications of how this may have come about are afforded
  by the lower group of the Anacrogynous Jungermanniaceae, and throughout
  the Acrogynous Jungermanniacae the plant has well-marked stem and leaves.
  The sporogonium even in the simplest forms has a sterile foot, but in
  this series also the origin of elaters from sterile cells can be traced.
  The Anthocerotales are a small and very distinct group, in which the
  gametophyte is a thallus, while the sporogonium possesses a sterile
  columella and is capable of long-continued growth and spore production.
  The mode of development of the sporogonium presents important differences
  in the three series that may be briefly referred to here. In fig. 4 young
  sporogonia of a number of liverworts are shown in longitudinal section,
  and the archesporial cells from which the spores and elaters will arise
  are shaded. In <i>Riccia</i> (fig. 4, A) the whole mass of cells derived
  from the ovum forms a spherical capsule, the only sterile tissue being
  the single layer of peripheral cells forming the wall. In other
  Marchantiales (fig. 4, B) the lower half of the embryo separated by the
  first transverse wall (1, I) forms the sterile foot and seta, while in
  the upper half (<i>ka</i>) the peripheral layer forms the wall of the
  capsule, enclosing the archesporial cells from which spores and elaters
  arise. In the Jungermanniales (fig. 4, C, E, F) the embryo is formed of a
  number of tiers of cells, and the archesporium is defined by the first
  divisions parallel to the surface in the cells of one or more of the
  upper tiers; a number of tiers go to form the seta and foot, while the
  lowest segment (<i>a</i>) usually forms a small appendage of the latter.
  In the Anthocerotales (fig. 4, D) the lowest tiers form the foot, and the
  terminal tier the capsule. The first periclinal divisions in the cells of
  the terminal tier separate a central group of cells which form the
  sterile columella (<i>col</i>). The archesporium arises by the next
  divisions in the outer layer of cells, and thus extends over the summit
  of the columella. In none of the liverworts does the sporogonium develop
  by means of an apical cell, as is the rule in mosses.</p>
         <p>Leaving details of form and structure to be considered under the
  several groups, some general features of the Hepaticae may be looked at
  here in relation to the conditions under which the plants live. The
  organization of the gametophyte stands in the closest relation to the
  factors of light and moisture in the environment. With hardly an
  exception the liverworts are dorsiventral, and usually one side is turned
  to the substratum and the other exposed to the light. In thalloid forms a
  thinner marginal expansion or a definite wing increasing the surface
  exposed to the light can be distinguished from a thicker midrib serving
  for storage and conduction. The leaves and stem of the foliose forms
  effect the same division of labour in another way. The relation of the
  plant to its water supply varies within the group. In the Marchantiales
  the chief supply is obtained from the soil by the rhizoids, and its loss
  in transpiration is regulated and controlled. In most liverworts, on the
  other hand, water is absorbed directly by the whole general surface, and
  the rhizoids are of subordinate importance. Many forms only succeed in a
  constantly humid atmosphere, while others sustain drying for a period,
  though their powers of assimilation and growth are suspended in the dry
  state. The cell-walls are capable of imbibing water rapidly, and their
  thickness stands in relation to this rather than to the prevention of
  loss of water from the plant. The large surface presented by the leafy
  forms facilitates the retention and absorption of water. The importance
  of prolonging the moistened condition as long as possible is further
  shown by special adaptations to retain water either between the appressed
  lobes of the leaves or in special pitcher-like sacs. In thalloid forms
  fimbriate or lobed margins or outgrowths from the surface lead to the
  same result. Sometimes adaptations to protect the plant during seasons of
  drought, such as the rolling up of the thallus in many xerophytic
  Marchantiales, can be recognized, but more often a prolonged dry season
  is survived in some resting state. The formation of subterranean tubers,
  which persist when the rest of the plant is killed by drought, is an
  interesting adaptation to this end, and is found in all three groups
  (<i>e.g.</i> in species of <i>Riccia</i>, <i>Fossombronia</i> and
  <i>Anthoceros</i>). No examples of total saprophytism or of parasitism
  are known, but two interesting cases of a symbiosis with other organisms
  which is probably a mutually beneficial one, though the nature of the
  physiological relation between the organisms is not clearly established,
  may be mentioned. Fungal hyphae occur in the rhizoids and in the cells of
  the lower region of the thallus of many liverworts, as in the endotrophic
  mycorhiza of higher plants. Colonies of <i>Nostoc</i> are constantly
  found in the Anthocerotaceae and in <i>Blasia</i>. In the latter they are
  protected by special concave scales, while in the Anthocerotaceae they
  occupy some of the mucilage slits between the cells of the lower surface
  of the thallus.</p>
         <p>Other adaptations concern the protection of the sexual organs and
  sporogonia, and the retention of water in the neighbourhood of the
  archegonia to enable the spermatozoid to reach the ovum. In thalloid
  forms the sexual organs are often sunk in depressions, while in the
  foliose forms protection is afforded by the surrounding leaves. In
  addition special involucres around the archegonia have arisen
  independently in several series. The characters of the sporogonium have
  as their object the nutrition and effective distribution of the spores,
  and only exceptionally, as in the Anthocerotaceae, are concerned with
  independent assimilation. In most forms the capsule is raised above the
  general surface at the time of opening, usually by the rapid growth of
  the seta, but in the Marchantiaceae by the sporogonia being raised on a
  special archegoniophore. The elaters serve as lines of conduction of
  plastic material to the developing spores, and later usually assist in
  their dispersal. The spores, with few exceptions, are unicellular when
  shed, and may develop at once or after a resting period. In their
  germination a short filament of a few cells is usually developed, and the
  apical cell of the plant is established in the terminal cell. In other
  cases a small plate or mass of cells is formed. With one or two
  exceptions, however, this preliminary <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page703">[v.04 p.0703]</ph>phase, which
  may be compared with the protonema of mosses, is of short duration.</p>
         <p>The power of vegetative propagation is widely spread. When
  artificially divided small fragments of the gametophyte are found to be
  capable of growing into new individuals. Apart from the separation of
  branches by the decay of older portions, special gemmae are found in many
  species. In <i>Aneura</i> the contents of superficial cells, after
  becoming surrounded by a new wall and dividing, escape as bi-cellular
  gemmae. Usually the gemmae arise by the outgrowth of superficial cells,
  and become free by breaking away from their stalk. When separated they
  may be single cells or consist of two or numerous cells. In <i>Blasia</i>
  and <i>Marchantia</i> the gemmae are formed within tubular or cup-shaped
  receptacles, out of which they are forced by the swelling of mucilage
  secreted by special hairs.</p>

            <i>Marchantiales.</i>—The plants of this group are most abundant
  in warm sunny localities, and grow for the most part on soil or rocks
  often in exposed situations. Nine genera are represented in Britain.
  <i>Targionia</i> is found on exposed rocks, but the other forms are less
  strikingly xerophytic; <ph outputclass="correction">
               <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>
            </ph> and <i>Lunularia</i> spread largely
  by the gemmae formed in the special gemma-cups on the thallus, and occur
  commonly in greenhouses. The large thallus of <i>Conocephalus</i> covers
  stones by the waterside, while <i>Dumortiera</i> is a hygrophyte confined
  to damp and shady situations. Among the Ricciaceae, most of which grow on
  soil, <i>Ricciocarpus</i> and <i>Riccia natans</i> occur floating on
  still water. The dorsiventral thallus is constructed on the same plan
  throughout the group, and shows a lower region composed of cells
  containing little chlorophyll and an upper stratum specialized for
  assimilation and transpiration. The lower region usually forms a more or
  less clearly marked midrib, and consists of parenchymatous cells, some of
  which may contain oil-bodies or be differentiated as mucilage cells or
  sclerenchyma fibres. Behind the apex, which has a number of initial
  cells, a series of amphigastria or ventral scales is formed. These
  consist of a single layer of cells, and their terminal appendages often
  fold over the apex and protect it. Usually they stand in two rows, but
  sometimes accessory rows occur, and in <i>Riccia</i> only a single median
  row is present. The thallus bears two sorts of rhizoids, wider ones with
  smooth walls which grow directly down into the soil, and longer, narrower
  ones, with peg-like thickenings of the wall projecting into the
  cell-cavity. The peg-rhizoids, which are peculiar to the group, converge
  under shelter of the amphigastria to the midrib, beneath which they form
  a wick-like strand. Through this water is conducted by capillarity as
  well as in the cell cavities. The upper stratum of the thallus is
  constructed to regulate the giving off of the water thus absorbed. It
  consists of a series of air-chambers (fig. 6, B) formed by certain lines
  of the superficial cells growing up from the surface, and as the thallus
  increases in area continuing to divide so as to roof in the chamber. The
  layer forming the roof is called the "epidermis," and the small opening
  left leading into the chamber is bounded by a special ring of cells and
  forms the "stoma" or air-pore. In most species of <i>Riccia</i> the
  air-chambers are only narrow passages, but in the other Marchantiales
  they are more extended. In the simplest cases the sides and base of the
  chambers perform the work of assimilation (<i>e.g.</i> 
            <i>Corsinia</i>).
  Usually the surface is extended by the development of partitions in the
  chambers (<i>Reboulia</i>), or by the growth from the floor of the
  chamber of short filaments of chlorophyllous cells (<i>Targionia</i>.
  <i>Marchantia</i>, fig. 6). The stomata may be simply surrounded by one
  or more series of narrower cells, or, as in the thallus of
  <i>Marchantia</i> and on the archegoniophores of other forms, may become
  barrel-shaped structures by the division of the ring of cells bounding
  the pore. In some cases the lowermost circle of cells can be approximated
  so as to close the pore. In <i>Dumortiera</i> the air-chambers are
  absent, their formation being only indicated at the apex.</p>

         <p>The sexual organs are always situated on the morphologically upper
  surface of the thallus. In <i>Riccia</i> they are scattered singly and
  protected by the air-chamber layer. The scattered position of the
  antheridia is also found in some of the higher forms, but usually they
  are grouped on special antheridiophores which in <i>Marchantia</i> are
  stalked, disk-shaped branch-systems (fig. 5). The individual antheridia
  are sunk in depressions from which the spermatozoids are in some cases
  forcibly ejected. The archegonial groups in <i>Corsinia</i> are sunk in a
  depression of the upper surface, while in <i>Targionia</i> they are
  displaced to the lower side of the anterior end of a branch. In all the
  other forms they are borne on special archegoniophores which have the
  form of a disk-shaped head borne on a stalk. The archegoniophore may be
  an upgrowth from the dorsal surface of the thallus (<i>e.g.</i>
            <i>Plagiochasma</i>), or the apex of the branch may take part in its
  formation. When the disk, around which archegonia are developed at
  intervals, is simply raised on a stalk-like continuation of the branch, a
  single groove protecting a strand of peg-rhizoids is found on the ventral
  face of the stalk (<i>Reboulia</i>). In the highest forms (<i>e.g.</i>
            <i>Marchantia</i>) the archegoniophore corresponds to the repeatedly
  branched continuation of the thallus, and the archegonia arise in
  relation to the growing points which are displaced to the lower surface
  of the disk. In this case two grooves are found in the stalk. The
  archegonia are protected by being sunk in depressions of the disk or by a
  special two-lipped involucre. In <i>Marchantia</i> and <i>Fimbriaria</i>
  an additional investment termed in descriptive works the perianth, grows
  up around each fertilized archegonium (fig. 1, 3, <i>d</i>). The simple
  sporogonium found in the Ricciaceae (fig. 4, A) has been described above;
  as the spores develop, the wall of the spherical capsule is absorbed and
  the spores lie free in the calyptra, by the decay of which they are set
  free. In <i>Corsinia</i> the capsule has a well-developed foot, but the
  sterile cells found among the spore-mother-cells do not become elaters,
  but remain thin-walled and simply contribute to the nutrition of the
  spores. In all other forms elaters with spirally thickened walls are
  found. The seta is short, the capsule being usually raised upon the
  archegoniophore. Dehiscence takes place either by the upper portion of
  the capsule splitting into short teeth or falling away as a whole or in
  fragments as a sort of operculum. The spores on germination form a short
  germ-tube, in the terminal cell of which the apical cell is established,
  but the direction of growth of the young thallus is usually not in the
  same straight line as the germ-tube. The Marchantiales are divided into a
  number of groups which represent distinct lines of advance from forms
  like the Ricciaceae, but the details of their classification cannot be
  entered upon here. The general nature of the progression exhibited by the
  group as a whole will, however, be evident from the above account.</p>

            <i>Jungermanniales.</i>—This large series of liverworts, which
  presents great variety in the organization of the sexual generation, is
  divided into two main groups according to whether the formation of
  archegonia terminates the growth of the branch or does not utilize the
  apex. The latter condition is characteristic of the more primitive group
  of the Anacrogynous Jungermanniaceae, in which the branch continues its
  growth after the formation of archegonia so that they (and later the
  sporogonia) stand on the dorsal surface of the thallus or leafy plant. In
  the Acrogynous Jungermanniaceae the plant is throughout foliose, and the
  archegonia occupy the ends of the main shoot or of its branches. The
  antheridia are usually globular and long-stalked. The capsule opens by
  splitting into four halves.</p>

            <i>Jungermanniaceae Anacrogynae.</i>—The great range of form in
  the sexual plant is well illustrated by the nine genera of this group
  <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page704">[v.04
  p.0704]</ph>which occur in Britain. One thalloid form has already been
  described in <i>Pellia</i> (fig. 2). <i>Sphaerocarpus</i>, which occurs
  rarely in stubble fields, is in many respects one of the simplest of the
  liverworts. The small thallus bears the antheridia and archegonia, each
  of which is surrounded by a tubular involucre, on the upper surface of
  distinct individuals. The sporogonium has a small foot, but the sterile
  cells among the spores do not develop into elaters. The same is true of
  the capsule of <i>Riella</i>. The plants of this genus, none of the
  species of which are British, grow in shallow water rooted in the mud,
  and are unlike all other liverworts in appearance. The usually erect
  thallus has a broad wing-like outgrowth from the dorsal surface and two
  rows of rather large scales below. No provision for the opening of the
  capsule exists in either of these genera. In <i>Aneura</i> the form of
  the plant may be complicated by a division of labour between root-like,
  stem-like and assimilating branches of the thallus. The sexual organs are
  borne on short lateral branches, while in the related genus
  <i>Metzgeria</i>, which occurs on rocks and tree trunks, the small sexual
  branches spring from the lower surface of the midrib of the narrow
  thallus. In these two genera the elaters are attached to a sterile group
  of cells projecting into the upper end of the capsule, and on dehiscence
  remain connected with the tips of the valves. <i>Pallavicinia</i> and
  some related genera have a definite midrib and broad wings formed of one
  layer of cells, and are of interest owing to the presence of a special
  water-conducting strand in the midrib. This consists of elongated
  lignified cells with pitted walls. <i>Blasia pusilla</i>, which occurs
  commonly by ditches and streams, affords a transition to the foliose
  types. Its thallus (fig. 7) has thin marginal lobes of limited growth,
  which are comparable to the more definite leaves of other anacrogynous
  forms. The ventral surface bears flat scales in addition to the concave
  scales which, as mentioned above, are inhabited by <i>Nostoc</i>. This
  interesting liverwort produces two kinds of gemmae, and in the localities
  in which it grows is largely reproduced by their means. In
  <i>Fossombronia</i>, of which there are a number of British species, the
  plant consists of a flattened stem creeping on muddy soil and bearing two
  rows of large obliquely-placed leaves. The sexual organs are borne on the
  upper surface of the midrib, and the sporogonium is surrounded by a
  bell-shaped involucre which grows up after fertilization. <i>Treubia</i>,
  which grows on rotting wood in the mountain forests of Java, is similarly
  differentiated into stem and leaf, and is the largest liverwort known,
  reaching a length of thirty centimetres. Lastly <i>Haplomitrium</i>, a
  rare British genus, forms with the exotic <i>Calobryum</i>, an isolated
  group which is most naturally placed among the anacrogynous forms
  although the archegonia are in terminal groups. The erect branches bear
  three rows of leaves, and spring from a creeping axis from which
  root-like branches destitute of rhizoids extend into the substratum.</p>

            <i>Jungermanniaceae Acrogynae.</i>—The plant consists of leafy
  shoots, the origin of which can be understood in the light of the foliose
  forms described above. The great majority of existing liverworts belong
  to this group, the general plan of construction of which is throughout
  very similar. In Britain thirty-nine genera with numerous species are
  found. With few exceptions the stem grows by means of a pyramidal apical
  cell cutting off three rows of segments. Each segment gives rise to a
  leaf, but usually the leaves of the ventral row (amphigastria) are
  smaller and differently shaped from those of the two lateral rows; in a
  number of genera they are wanting altogether. Sometimes the leaves retain
  their transverse insertion on the stem, and the two lobes of which they
  consist are developed equally. More often they come to be obliquely
  inserted, the anterior edge of each leaf lying under or over the edge of
  the leaf in front. The two lobes are often unequally developed. In
  <i>Scapania</i> the upper lobe is the smaller, while in <i>Radula</i>,
  <i>Poretta</i> and the <i>Lejeuneae</i> this is the case with the lower
  lobe. The folding of one lobe against another assists in the retention of
  water. Pitcher-like structures have arisen in different ways in a number
  of genera, and are especially common in epiphytic forms
  (<i>Frullania</i>, <i>Lepidolaena</i>, <i>Pleurozia</i>). In some forms
  the leaves are finely divided, and along with the hair-like paraphyllia
  form a loose weft around the stem (<i>Trichocolea</i>). The rhizoids
  spring from the lower surface of the stem, and sometimes from the bases
  of the leaves. The branches arise below and by the side of the
  leaves.</p>

         <p>The sexual organs may occur on the same or on distinct individuals.
  The antheridia are protected by leaves which are often modified in shape.
  The archegonia are borne at the apex of the main stem or of a lateral
  branch. A single archegonium may arise from the apical cell
  (<i>Lejeunea</i>); more commonly a number of others are formed from the
  surrounding segments. The leaves below the archegonial group are
  frequently modified in size and shape, but the chief protection is
  afforded by a tubular perianth, which corresponds to a coherent whorl of
  leaves and grows up independently of fertilization. The perianth serves
  also to enclose and protect the sporogonium during its development. In a
  number of forms belonging to different groups the end of the stem on
  which the sporogonium is borne grows downwards so as to form a hollow
  tubular sac enclosing the sporogonium; in other cases this marsupial sac
  is formed by the base of the sporogonium boring into the thickened end of
  the stem. The sac usually penetrates into the soil and bears rhizoids on
  its outer surface. <i>Kantia</i>, <i>Calypogeia</i> and <i>Saccogyna</i>
  are British forms, which have their sporogonia protected in this way. The
  sporogonium is very similar throughout the group (figs. 8, 9). At
  maturity the seta elongates rapidly, and the wall of the capsule splits
  more or less completely into four valves, allowing the elaters and spores
  to escape. In the Jubuloideae, which in other respects form a well-marked
  group, the seta is short and the elaters extend from the upper part of
  the capsule to the base; at dehiscence they remain fixed to the valves
  into which the capsule splits. The germinating spore usually forms a
  short filament, but in other cases a flat plate of cells growing by a
  two-sided apical cell is first formed (<i>Radula</i>, <i>Lejeunea</i>).
  In one or two tropical forms the pro-embryonic stage is prolonged, and
  leafy shoots only arise in connexion with the sexual organs. In
  <i>Protocephalozia</i>, which grows on bare earth in South America, this
  pro-embryo is filamentous, while in <i>Lejeunea Metzgeriopsis</i>, which
  grows on the leaves of living plants, it is a flat branched thallus
  closely applied to the substratum. Other cases of the plant being, with
  the exception of the sexual branches, apparently thalloid, are on the
  other hand to be explained as due to the reduction of the leaves and
  flattening of the stem of a shoot (<i>Pteropsiella</i>,
  <i>Zoopsis</i>).</p>
         <p>The Acrogynous Jungermanniaceae fall into a number of natural groups,
  which cannot, however, be followed out here. They occur in very various
  situations, on the ground, on rocks and stones, on tree trunks, and, in
  the damp tropics, on leaves. Usually they form larger or smaller tufts of
  a green colour, but some forms have a reddish tint.</p>

            <i>Anthocerotales.</i>—This small and very natural group
  includes the three genera <i>Anthoceros</i>, <i>Dendroceros</i> and
  <i>Notothylas</i>, and stands in <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page705">[v.04 p.0705]</ph>many respects
  in an isolated position among the Bryophyta. Three species of
  <i>Anthoceros</i> occur in Britain, growing on the damp soil of fields,
  ditches, &amp;c. The dark green thallus has an ill-defined midrib, and is
  composed of parenchymatous cells. In each assimilating cell there is
  usually a single large chloroplast. The apical region, which has a single
  initial cell, is protected by mucilage secreted by the mucilage slits,
  which are small pit-like depressions between superficial cells of the
  lower surface. Mucilage is also often formed in intercellular spaces
  within the thallus. Colonies of <i>Nostoc</i> are constantly found living
  in some of the mucilage slits which then become enlarged. The sexual
  organs are scattered over the upper surface. The stalked globular
  antheridia are exceptional in being formed endogenously, and are situated
  in groups in special intercellular spaces. The superficial layer of cells
  bounding the cavity does not break down until the antheridia are nearly
  mature. Occasionally antheridia develop on the surface of shaded portions
  of the thallus. The necks of the archegonia hardly project above the
  general surface of the thallus. In structure and development they agree
  with other Hepaticae, though differences of detail exist. The young
  sporogonium is protected by a thick calyptra derived from the tissue of
  the thallus around the archegonium. The sporogonium consists of a large
  bulbous foot, the superficial cells of which grow out into processes, and
  a long capsule, which continues to grow for months by the activity of a
  zone of cells between it and the foot, and may attain the length of an
  inch and a half. The wall of the capsule is several layers of cells
  thick, and since the epidermis contains functional stomata and the
  underlying cells possess chlorophyll it is capable of assimilation. In
  the centre of the capsule is a strand of narrow elongated cells forming
  the columella, and between this and the wall spores mixed with elaters
  are formed from the dome-shaped archesporium, the origin of which has
  already been described (fig. 4, D). The capsule opens by splitting into
  two valves from the apex downwards, and the mature spores escape while
  others are developing in succession below. In <i>Dendroceros</i>, which
  grows as an epiphyte in the tropics, the thallus has a well-defined
  midrib and broad wings composed of a single layer of cells. The capsule
  is similar to that of <i>Anthoceros</i>, but has no stomata, and the
  elaters have spirally thickened walls. Some species of <i>Anthoceros</i>
  agree with it in these respects. <i>Notothylas</i> resembles
  <i>Anthoceros</i> in its thallus, but the sporogonium is much smaller. In
  some species, although the columella and archesporium arise in the usual
  way, both give rise to mingled spores and elaters, and no sterile
  columella is developed.</p>

            <i>Funaria hygrometrica</i> is a moss of very common occurrence even
  in towns on the soil of paths, at the foot of walls and in similar
  places. The small plants grow closely crowded in tufts, and consist of
  short leafy shoots attached to the soil by numerous fine rhizoids. The
  latter, in contrast to the rhizoids of liverworts, are composed of rows
  of elongated cells and are branched. The leaves are simple, and except
  for the midrib are only one layer of cells thick. The structure of the
  stem though simple is more complicated than in any liverwort. The
  superficial cells are thick-walled, and there is a central strand of
  narrow cells forming a water-conducting tissue. The small strand of
  elongated cells in the midrib of the leaf runs down into the stem, but is
  not usually connected with the central strand. The sexual organs are
  developed in groups at the apices, the antheridial group usually
  terminating the main axis while the archegonia are borne on a lateral
  branch. The brown tint of the hair-like paraphyses mixed with antheridia
  (fig. 15) makes the male branch conspicuous, while the archegonia have to
  be carefully looked for enclosed by the surrounding leaves (fig. 16, B).
  The sporogonium developed from the fertilized ovum grows by means of a
  two-sided apical cell (fig. 16 A), and is at first of uniform thickness.
  After a time the upper region increases in diameter and forms the
  capsule, while the lower portion forms the long seta and the foot which
  is embedded in the end of the stem. With the growth of the sporogonium
  the archegonial wall, which for a time kept pace with it, is broken
  through, the larger upper part terminated by the neck being carried up on
  the capsule as the calyptra, while the basal portion remains as a tubular
  sheath round the lower end of the seta (cf. figs. 16, C, and fig. 11, A,
  B). The seta widens out at the base of the capsule into a region known as
  the apophysis. The peripheral cells of the seta are thick-walled, and it
  has a central strand of elongated conducting cells. In the epidermis of
  the apophysis functional stomata, similar to those of the higher plants,
  are present and, since cells containing chlorophyll are present below the
  superficial layers of the apophysis and capsule, the sporogonium is
  capable of independent assimilation. The construction of the capsule will
  be best understood from the median longitudinal section (fig. 11, C). The
  central region extending between the apophysis and the operculum is
  composed of sterile tissue and forms the columella (<i>c</i>).
  Immediately around this is the layer of cells from which the spores will
  be developed (<i>s</i>), and the layers of cells on either side of this
  form the walls of the spore-sac, which will contain the spores. Between
  the wall of the capsule, which is composed of several layers of cells,
  and the spore-sac is a wide intercellular space (<i>h</i>) bridged across
  by trabeculae consisting of rows of chlorophyll-containing cells. At the
  junction of the operculum (<i>d</i>) with the rest of the capsule is a
  circle of cells forming the annulus (<i>a</i>), by help of which the
  operculum is detached at maturity as a small lid. Its removal does not,
  however, leave the mouth of the capsule wide open, for around the margin
  are two circles of pointed teeth forming the peristome. These are the
  thickened cell-walls of a definite layer of cells (<i>p</i>), and appear
  <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page706">[v.04
  p.0706]</ph>as separate teeth owing to the breaking down of the
  unthickened cell-walls. The numerous spores which have been developed in
  the spore sac can thus only escape from the pendulous capsule through
  narrow slits between the teeth, and these are closed in damp air. The
  unicellular spores when supplied with moisture germinate (fig. 12) and
  give rise to the sexual generation. A filamentous protonema is first
  developed, some of the branches of which are exposed to the light and
  contain abundant chlorophyll, while others penetrate the substratum as
  brown or colourless rhizoids. The moss-plants arise from single
  projecting cells, and numerous plants may spring from the protonema
  developed from a single spore.</p>

         <p>The majority of the mosses belong to the same great group as
  <i>Funaria</i>, the Bryales. The other two subdivisions of the Musci are
  each represented by a single genus. In the Andreaeales the columella does
  not extend to the upper end of the capsule, and the latter opens by a
  number of lateral slits. The Sphagnales also have a dome-shaped spore-sac
  continued over the columella, and, though their capsule opens by an
  operculum, they differ widely from other mosses in the development of the
  sporogonium as well as in the characters of the sexual generation. The
  three groups are described separately below, but some more general
  features of the mosses may be considered here.</p>
         <p>On the whole mosses grow in drier situations than the liverworts, and
  the arrangements they present for the conduction of water in the plant
  are also more complete and suggest in some cases comparisons with the
  higher plants. In spite of this, however, they are in great part
  dependent on the absorption of water through the general surface of the
  shoot, and the power of rapid imbibition possessed by their cell-walls,
  the crowded position of the small leaves on the stem, and special
  adaptations for the retention of water on the surface, have the same
  significance as in the foliose liverworts. The different appearance of
  exposed mosses in dry weather and after a shower illustrates this
  relation to the water supply. The protonema is always a well-marked stage
  in the life-history. Not only does a moss-plant never arise directly from
  the spore, but in all cases of vegetative reproduction, apart from the
  separation of branches by decay of older regions of the plant, a
  protonema is found. Usually the protonema is filamentous and ceases to be
  evident after the plants have developed. But in some small mosses (e.g.
  <i>Ephemerum</i>) it plays the chief part in assimilation and lives on
  from year to year. In <i>Sphagnum</i>, <i>Andreaea</i> and some genera of
  the Bryales the protonema or some of its branches have the form of flat
  plates or masses of cells. The formation of the moss-plant on the
  protonema is always from a single cell and is similar in all mosses. The
  first three walls in this cell intersect one another, and define the
  three-sided pyramidal apical cell by means of which the shoot continues
  to grow. In <i>Fissidens</i> and a few other mosses the apical cell is
  two-sided. The leaves formed by the successive segments gradually attain
  their normal size and structure. Each segment of the initial cell gives
  rise to a leaf and a portion of the stem; the branches arise from the
  lower portion of a segment and stand immediately below a leaf. The leaves
  may form three vertical rows, but usually their arrangement, owing to the
  direction of the segment walls at the apex, becomes more complicated.
  Their growth proceeds by means of a two-sided apical cell, and the midrib
  does not become more than one cell thick until later. In addition to the
  leaves the stem often bears hair-like structures of different kinds, some
  of which correspond to modified branches of protonema. The branched
  filamentous rhizoids which spring from the lower region of the stem also
  correspond to protonemal branches. The structure of both stem and leaf
  reaches a high grade of organization in some mosses. Not only are
  thick-walled sclerenchymatous cells developed to give rigidity to the
  periphery of the stem and the midrib of the leaf, but in many cases a
  special water-conducting tissue, consisting of elongated cells, the end
  walls of which are thin and oblique, forms a definite central strand in
  the stem. In the forms in which it is most highly developed
  (Polytrichaceae) this tissue, which is comparable with the xylem of
  higher plants, is surrounded by a zone of tissue physiologically
  comparable to phloem, and in the rhizome may be limited by an endodermis.
  The conducting strands in the leaves show the same tissues as in the
  central strand of the stem, and in the Polytrichaceae and some other
  mosses are in continuity with it. The independent origin of this
  conducting system is of great interest for comparison with the vascular
  system of the sporophyte of the higher plants.</p>
         <p>The sexual organs, with the exception of the antheridia of
  <i>Sphagnum</i>, are borne at the apices of the main shoot or of
  branches. Their general similarity to the mature antheridia and
  archegonia of liverworts and the main difference in their development
  have been referred to. The antheridia open by means of a cap cell or
  groups of cells with mucilaginous contents. The details of construction
  of the sporogonium are referred to below. In all cases (except
  <i>Archidium</i>) a columella is present, and all the cells derived from
  the archesporium produce spores, no elaters being formed. In a few cases
  the germination of the spore commences within the capsule. The
  development of the sporogonium proceeds in all cases (except in
  <i>Sphagnum</i>) by means of an apical cell cutting off two rows of
  segments. The first periclinal division in the region forming the capsule
  separates an inner group of cells (the endothecium) form the peripheral
  layer (amphithecium). In <i>Sphagnum</i>, as in <i>Anthoceros</i>, the
  archesporium is derived from the amphithecium; in all other mosses it is
  the outermost layer of the endothecium.</p>
         <p>Vegetative propagation is widely spread in the mosses, and, as
  mentioned above, a protonema is always formed in the development of the
  new plant. The social growth of the plants characteristic of many mosses
  is a result of the formation of numerous plants on the original protonema
  and on developments from the rhizoids. Besides this, gemmae may be formed
  on the protonema, on the leaves or at the apex, and some mosses have
  specialized shoots for their better protection or distribution. Thus in
  <i>Georgia</i> the stalked, multicellular gemmae are borne at the ends of
  shoots surrounded by a rosette of larger leaves, and in <i>Aulacomnium
  androgynum</i> they are raised on an elongated leafless region of the
  shoot. In other cases detached leaves or shoots may give rise to new
  plants, and when a moss is artificially divided almost any fragment may
  serve for reproduction.</p>
         <p>Even in those rare cases in which the sexual generation can be
  developed without the intervention of spore production from the tissues
  of the sporogonium, a protonema is formed from cut pieces of the seta or
  in some cases from intact sporogonia still attached to the plant. This
  phenomenon of <i>apospory</i> was first discovered in mosses, but is now
  also known in a number of ferns (see <ph outputclass="sc">Pteridophyta</ph>).</p>

            <i>Sphagnales.</i>—The single genus <i>Sphagnum</i> occupies a
  very distinct and isolated position among mosses. The numerous species,
  which are familiar as the bog-mosses, are so similar that minute
  structural characters have to be relied on in their identification. The
  plants occur in large patches of a pale green or reddish colour on moors,
  and, when filling up small lakes or pools, may attain a length of some
  feet. Their growth has played a large part in the formation of peat. The
  species are distributed in temperate and arctic climates, but in the
  tropics only occur at high levels. The protonema forms a flat, lobed,
  thalloid structure attached to the soil by rhizoids, and the plants arise
  from marginal cells. The main shoot bears numerous branches which appear
  to stand in whorls; some of them bend down and become applied to the
  surface of the main axis. The structure of the stem and leaves is
  peculiar. The former shows on cross-section a thin-walled central tissue
  surrounded by a zone of thick-walled cells. Outside this come one to five
  layers of large clear cells, which when mature are dead and empty; their
  walls are strengthened with a spiral thickening and perforated with round
  pores. They serve to absorb and conduct water by capillarity. The leaves
  have no midrib and similar empty cells occur regularly among the narrow
  chlorophyll-containing cells, which thus appear as a green network. The
  antheridia are globular and have long stalks. They stand by the side of
  leaves of special club-shaped branches. The archegonial groups occupy the
  apices of short branches (fig. 13, A.). The mature sporogonium consists
  of a wide foot separated by a constriction from the globular capsule (B).
  There is no distinct seta, but the capsule is raised on a leafless
  outgrowth of the end of the branch called a pseudopodium (C, <i>qs</i>).
  The capsule, the wall of which bears rudimentary stomata, has a small
  operculum but no peristome. There is a short, wide columella, over which
  the dome-shaped spore-sac extends, and no air-space is present between
  the spore-sac and the wall. In the embryo a number of tiers of cells are
  first formed. The lower tiers <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page707">[v.04 p.0707]</ph>form the foot, while in the upper
  part the first divisions mark off the columella, around which the
  archesporium, derived from the amphithecium, extends. The sporogonium
  when nearly mature bursts the calyptra irregularly. The capsule opens
  explosively in dry weather, the operculum and spores being thrown to a
  distance. The spore on germination forms a short filament which soon
  broadens out into the thalloid protonema. Some twelve species of
  <i>Sphagnum</i> are found in Britain.</p>

            <i>Andreaeales.</i>—The species of the single genus
  <i>Andreaea</i> (fig. 14) are small, dark-coloured mosses growing for the
  most part in tufts on bare rocks in alpine and arctic regions. Four
  species occur on alpine rocks in Britain. The spore on germination gives
  rise to a small mass of cells from which one or more short filaments
  grow. The filament soon broadens into a ribbon-shaped thallus, several
  cells thick, which is closely applied to the rock. Erect branches may
  arise from the protonema, and gemmae may be developed on it. The stem of
  the plant, which arises in the usual way, has no conducting strand and
  the leaves may or may not have midribs. The leaf grows by a dome-shaped
  instead of by the usual two-sided initial cell. The antheridia are
  long-stalked. The upper portion of the archegonial wall is carried up as
  a calyptra on the sporogonium, which, as in <i>Sphagnum</i>, has no seta
  and is raised on a pseudopodium. The development of the sporogonium
  proceeds as in the Bryales, but the dome-shaped archesporium extends over
  the summit of the columella and an air-space is wanting. The capsule does
  not open by an operculum but by four or six longitudinal slits, which do
  not reach either the base or apex. In one exotic species the splits occur
  only at the upper part of the capsule, and the terminal cap breaks away.
  This isolated example thus appears to approach the Bryales in its mode of
  dehiscence.</p>
         <p>
            <i>Bryales.</i>—In contrast to the preceding two this group
  includes a very large number of genera and species. Thus even in Britain
  between five and six hundred species belonging to more than one hundred
  genera are found. They occur in the most varied situations, on soil, on
  rocks and trees, and, in a few instances (<i>Fontinalis</i>), in water.
  Although exhibiting a wide range in size and in the structural complexity
  of both generations, they all conform to a general type, so that
  <i>Funaria</i>, described above, will serve as a fair example of the
  group. The protonema is usually filamentous, and in some of the simplest
  forms is long-lived, while the small plants borne on it serve mainly to
  protect the sexual organs and sporogonia. This is the case in
  <i>Ephemerum</i>, which grows on the damp soil of clayey fields, and the
  plants are even more simply constructed in <i>Buxbaumia</i>, which occurs
  on soil rich in humus and is possibly partially saprophytic. In this moss
  the filamentous protonema is capable of assimilation, but the leaves of
  the small plants are destitute of chlorophyll, so that they are dependent
  on the protonema. The male plant has no definite stem, and consists of a
  single concave leaf protecting the antheridium. The female plant is
  rather more highly organized, consisting of a short stem bearing a few
  leaves around the group of archegonia. The sporogonium is of large size
  and highly organized, though it presents peculiar features in the
  peristome. <i>Buxbaumia</i> has been regarded by Goebel as representing a
  stage which other mosses have passed, and has been described by him as
  the simplest type of moss. In <i>Ephemerum</i> also we may probably
  regard the relation of the small plants to the protonema as a primitive
  one. On the other hand, in the case of <i>Ephemeropsis</i>, which grows
  on the leaves of living plants in Java, the high organization of the
  sporogonium makes it probable that the persistent protonema is an
  adaptation to the peculiar conditions of life. A highly developed
  protonema provided with leaf-like assimilating organs is found in
  <i>Georgia</i>, <i>Diphyscium</i> and <i>Oedipodium</i>, all of which
  show peculiarities in the sporogonium as well. The cells of the protonema
  of <i>Schistostega</i>, which lives in the shade of caves, are so
  constructed as to concentrate the feeble available light on the
  chloroplasts.</p>
         <p>We may perhaps regard the persistent protonema bearing small leafy
  plants as a primitive condition, and look upon those larger plants which
  remain unbranched and bear the sexual organs at the apex (e.g.
  <i>Schistostega</i>) as representing the next stage. From this condition
  different lines of specialization in the form and structure of the plant
  can be recognized. A large number of mosses stand at about the same grade
  as <i>Funaria</i>, in that the plants are small, sparingly branched,
  usually radial, and do not show a very highly differentiated internal
  structure. In others the form of the plant becomes more complex by
  copious branching and the differentiation of shoots of different orders.
  In these cases the shoot system is often more or less dorsiventral, and
  the sexual organs are borne on short lateral branches (e.g. <i>Thuidium
  tamariscinum</i>). The Polytrichaceae, on the other hand, show a
  specialization in structure rather than in form. The high organization of
  their conducting system has been referred to above, but though many
  species are able to exist in relatively dry situations, the plants are
  still dependent on the absorption of water by the general surface. The
  parallel lamellae of assimilating cells which grow from the upper surface
  of the leaf in these and some other mosses probably serve to retain water
  in the neighbourhood of the assimilating cells and so prolong their
  activity. As common adaptive features in the leaves the occurrence of
  papillae or outgrowths of the cell-walls to retain water, and the white
  hairlike leaf tips, which assist in protecting the young parts at the
  apex of many xerophytic mosses, may be mentioned. The leaves of
  <i>Leucobryum</i>, which occurs in pale green tufts in shaded woods, show
  a parallel adaptation to that found in <i>Sphagnum</i>. They are several
  cells thick, and the small assimilating cells lie between two layers of
  empty water-storage cells, the walls of which are perforated by
  pores.</p>
         <p>With the possible exception of <i>Archidium</i>, the sporogonium is
  throughout the Bryales constructed on one plan. <i>Archidium</i> is a
  small moss occurring occasionally on the soil of wet fields. The
  protonema is not persistent, and the plants are well developed,
  resembling those of <i>Pleuridium</i>. The sporogonium has a small foot
  and practically no seta, and differs in the development and structure of
  its capsule from all other mosses. The spores are derived from the
  endothecium, but no distinction of a sterile columella and an
  archesporium is established in this, a variable number of its cells
  becoming spore-mother-cells while the rest serve to nourish the spores.
  The layer of cells immediately around the endothecium becomes the
  spore-sac, and an air-space forms between this and the wall of the
  capsule. The very large, thin-walled spores escape on the decay of the
  capsule, which ruptures the archegonial wall irregularly. On account of
  the absence of a columella <i>Archidium</i> is sometimes placed in a
  distinct group, but since its peculiarities have possibly arisen by
  reduction it seems at present best retained among the Bryales. In all
  other Bryales there is a definite columella extending from the base to
  the apex of the capsule, the archesporium is derived from the outermost
  layer of cells of the endothecium, and an air space is formed between the
  spore-sac and the wall. In the Polytrichaceae another air space separates
  the spore-sac from the columella. There is great variety in the length of
  the seta, which is sometimes practically absent. The apophysis, which may
  be a more or less distinct region, usually bears stomata and is the main
  organ of assimilation. In the Splachnaceae it is expanded for this
  purpose, while in <i>Oedipodium</i> it constitutes most of the long pale
  stalk which supports the capsule. A distinct operculum is usually
  detached by the help of the annulus, and its removal may leave the mouth
  of the capsule widely open. More usually there is a peristome, consisting
  of one or two series of teeth, which serves to narrow the opening and in
  various ways to ensure the gradual shedding of the spores in dry weather.
  In most mosses the teeth are portions of thickened cell-walls but in the
  Polytrichaceae they are formed of a number of sclerenchymatous cells. In
  <i>Polytrichum</i> a membranous epiphragm stretches across the wide mouth
  of the capsule between the tips of the short peristome teeth, and closes
  the opening except for the interspaces of the peristome.</p>
         <p>In a number of forms, which were formerly grouped together, the
  capsule does not open to liberate the spores. These cleistocarpous forms
  are now recognized as related to various natural groups, in which the
  majority of the species possess an operculum. In such forms as
  <i>Phascum</i> the columella persists, and the only peculiarity is in the
  absence of arrangements for dehiscence. In <i>Ephemerum</i> 
            <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page708">[v.04 p.0708]</ph>(and
  the closely related <i>Nanomitrium</i> which has a small operculum) the
  columella becomes absorbed during the development of the spores. Stomata
  are present on the wall of the small capsule. Such facts as these suggest
  that in many cases the cleistocarpous condition is the result of
  reduction rather than primitive, and that possibly the same holds for
  <i>Archidium</i>.</p>
         <p>The former subdivision of the Bryales into Musci Cleistocarpi and
  Musci Stegocarpi according to the absence or presence of an operculum is
  thus clearly artificial. The same holds even more obviously for the
  grouping of the stegocarpous forms into those in which the archegonial
  group terminates a main axis (acrocarpi) and those in which it is borne
  on a more or less developed lateral branch (pleurocarpi). Modern
  classifications of the Bryales depend mainly on the construction of the
  peristome.</p>

         <p>It remains to be considered to what extent the several natural groups
  of plants classed together in the Bryophyta can be placed in a
  phylogenetic relation to one another. Practically no help is afforded by
  palaeobotany, and only the comparison of existing forms can be depended
  on. The indications of probable lines of evolution are clearest in the
  Hepaticae. The Marchantiales form an obviously natural evolutionary
  group, and the same is probably true of the Jungermanniales, although in
  neither case can the partial lines of progression within the main groups
  be said to be quite clear. Such a form as <i>Sphaerocarpus</i>, which has
  features in common with the lower Marchantiales, enables us to form an
  idea of the divergence of the two groups from a common ancestry. The
  Anthocerotales, on the other hand, stand in an isolated position, and
  recent researches have served to emphasize this rather than to confirm
  the relationship with the Jungermanniales suggested by Leitgeb. The
  indications of a serial progression are not so clear in the mosses, but
  the majority of the forms may be regarded as forming a great phylogenetic
  group in the evolution of which the elaboration of the moss-plant has
  proceeded until the protonema appears as a mere preliminary stage to the
  formation of the plants. Parallel with the evolution of the gametophyte
  in form and structure, a progression can be traced in the sporogonium,
  although the simplest sporogonia available for study may owe much of
  their simplicity to reduction. The Andreaeales may perhaps be looked on
  as a divergent primitive branch of the same stock. On the other hand, the
  Sphagnales show such considerable and important differences from the rest
  of the mosses, that like the Anthocerotales among the liverworts, they
  may be regarded as a group, the relationship of which to the main stem is
  at least problematical. Between the Hepaticae, Anthocerotales, Sphagnales
  and Musci, there are no connecting forms known, and it must be left as an
  open question whether the Bryophyta are a monophyletic or polyphyletic
  group.</p>
         <p>The question of the relationship of the Bryophyta on the one hand to
  the Thallophyta and on the other to the Pteridophyta lies even more in
  the region of speculation, on slender grounds without much hope of
  decisive evidence. In a general sense we may regard the Bryophyta as
  derived from an algal ancestry, without being able to suggest the nature
  of the ancestral forms or the geological period at which they arose.
  Recent researches on those Algae such as <i>Coleochaete</i> which
  appeared to afford a close comparison in their alternation of generations
  with <i>Riccia</i>, have shown that the body resulting from the
  segmentation of the fertilized ovum is not so strictly comparable in the
  two cases as had been supposed. The series of increasingly complex
  sporogonia among Bryophytes appears to be most naturally explained on an
  hypothesis of progressive sterilization of sporogenous tissue, such as
  has been advanced by Bower. On the other hand there are not wanting
  indications of reduction in the Bryophyte sporogonium which make an
  alternative view of its origin at least possible. With regard to the
  relationship of the Bryophyta and Pteridophyta the article on the latter
  group should be consulted. It will be sufficient to say in conclusion
  that while the alternating generations in the two groups are strictly
  comparable, no evidence of actual relationship is yet forthcoming.</p>
