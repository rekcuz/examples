   <title>BRITISH COLUMBIA</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRITISH COLUMBIA,--> the western province of the Dominion of
  Canada. It is bounded on the east by the continental watershed in the
  Rocky Mountains, until this, in its north-westerly course, intersects
  120° W., which is followed north to 60° N., thus including within the
  province a part of the Peace river country to the east of the mountains.
  The southern boundary is formed by 49° N. and the strait separating
  Vancouver Island from the state of Washington. The northern boundary is
  60° N., the western the Pacific Ocean, upon which the province fronts for
  about 600 m., and the coast strip of Alaska for a further distance of 400
  m. Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Islands, as well as the
  smaller islands lying off the western coast of Canada, belong to the
  province of British Columbia.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Physical Features.</i>—British Columbia is essentially a
  mountainous country, for the Rocky Mountains which in the United States
  lie to the east of the Great Basin, on running to the north bear toward
  the west and approach the ranges which border the Pacific coast. Thus
  British Columbia comprises practically the entire width of what has been
  termed the Cordillera or Cordilleran belt of North America, between the
  parallels of latitude above indicated. There are two ruling mountain
  systems in this belt—the Rocky Mountains proper on the north-east
  side, and the Coast Range on the south-west or Pacific side. Between
  these are subordinate ranges to which various local names have been
  given, as well as the "Interior Plateau"—an elevated tract of hilly
  country, the hill summits having an accordant altitude, which lies to the
  east of the Coast Range. The several ranges, having been produced by
  successive foldings of the earth's crust in a direction parallel to the
  border of the Pacific Ocean, have a common trend which is south-east and
  north-west. Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Islands are remnants
  of still another mountain range, which runs parallel to the coast but is
  now almost entirely submerged beneath the waters of the Pacific. The
  province might be said to consist of a series of parallel mountain ranges
  with long narrow valleys lying between them.</p>
      <p>The Rocky Mountains are composed chiefly of palaeozoic sediments
  ranging in age from the Cambrian to the Carboniferous, with subordinate
  infolded areas of Cretaceous which hold coal. The average height of the
  range along the United States boundary is 8000 ft., but the range
  culminates between the latitudes of 51° and 53°, the highest peak in the
  Canadian Rockies being Mount Robson, 13,700 ft., although the highest
  peak in British Columbia is Mount Fairweather on the International
  Boundary, which rises to 15,287 ft. Other high peaks in the Rocky
  Mountains of Canada are Columbia, 12,740 ft.; Forbes, 12,075;
  Assiniboine, 11,860; Bryce. 11,686; Temple, 11,626; Lyell, 11,463. There
  are a number of passes over the Rocky Mountains, among which may be
  mentioned, beginning from the south, the South Kootenay or Boundary Pass,
  7100 ft.; the Crow's Nest Pass, 5500 (this is traversed by the southern
  branch of the Canadian Pacific railway and crosses great coal fields);
  the Kicking Horse or Wapta Pass, 5300 (which is traversed by the main
  line of the Canadian Pacific railway); the Athabasca Pass, 6025; the
  Yellow Head Pass, 3733 (which will probably be used by the Grand Trunk
  Pacific railway); the Pine River Pass, 2850; and the Peace River Pass,
  2000, through which the Peace river flows.</p>
      <p>The Coast Range, sometimes called the Cascade Range, borders the
  Pacific coast for 900 m. and gives to it its remarkable character. To its
  partially submerged transverse valleys are due the excellent harbours on
  the coast, the deep sounds and inlets which penetrate far inland at many
  points, as well as the profound and gloomy fjords and the stupendous
  precipices which render the coast line an exaggerated reproduction of
  that of Norway. The coast is, in fact, one of the most remarkable in the
  world, measuring with all its indentations 7000 m. in the aggregate, and
  being fringed with an archipelago of innumerable islands, of which
  Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Islands are the largest.</p>
      <p>Along the south-western side of the Rocky Mountains is a very
  remarkable valley of considerable geological antiquity, in which some
  seven of the great rivers of the Pacific slope, among them the Kootenay,
  Columbia, Fraser and Finlay, flow for portions of their upper courses.
  This valley, which is from 1 to 6 m. in width, can be traced continuously
  for a length of at least 800 m. One of the most important rivers of the
  province is the Fraser, which, rising in the Rocky Mountains, flows for a
  long distance to the north-west, and then turning south eventually
  crosses the Coast Range by a deep canton-like valley and empties into the
  Strait of Georgia, a few miles south of the city of Vancouver. The
  Columbia, which rises farther south in the same range, flows north for
  about 150 m., crossing the main line of the Canadian Pacific railway at
  Donald, and then bending abruptly back upon its former course, flows
  south, recrossing the Canadian Pacific railway at Revelstoke, and on
  through the Arrow Lakes in the Kootenay country into the United States,
  emptying into the Pacific Ocean at Astoria in the state of Oregon. These
  lakes, as well as the other large lakes in southern British Columbia,
  remain open throughout the winter. In the north-western part of the
  province the Skeena flows south-west into the Pacific, and still farther
  to the north the Stikine rises in British Columbia, but before entering
  the Pacific crosses the coast strip of Alaska. The Liard, rising in the
  same district, flows east and falls into the Mackenzie, which empties
  into the Arctic Ocean. The headwaters of the Yukon are also situated in
  the northern part of the province. All these rivers are swift and are
  frequently interrupted by rapids, so that, as means of communication for
  commercial purposes, they are of indifferent value. Wherever lines of
  railway are constructed, they lose whatever importance they may have held
  in this respect previously.</p>
      <p>At an early stage in the Glacial period British Columbia was covered
  by the Cordilleran glacier, which moved south-eastwards and
  north-westwards, in correspondence with the ruling features of the
  country, from a gathering-ground situated in the vicinity of the 57th
  parallel. Ice from this glacier poured through passes in the coast
  ranges, and to a lesser extent debouched upon the edge of the great
  plains, beyond the Rocky Mountain range. The great valley between the
  coast ranges and Vancouver Island was also occupied by a glacier that
  moved in both directions from a central point in the vicinity of Valdez
  Island. The effects of this glacial action and of the long periods of
  erosion preceding it and of other physiographic changes connected with
  its passing away, have most important bearings on the distribution and
  character of the gold-bearing alluviums of the province.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Climate.</i>—The subjoined figures relating to temperature
  and precipitation are from a table prepared by Mr R.F. Stupart, director
  of the meteorological service. The station at Victoria may be taken as
  representing the conditions of the southern part of the coast of British
  Columbia, although the rainfall is much greater on exposed parts of the
  outer coast. Agassiz represents the Fraser delta and Kamloops the
  southern interior district. The mean temperature naturally decreases to
  the northward of these selected stations, both along the coast and in the
  interior, while the precipitation increases. The figures given for Port
  Simpson are of interest, as the Pacific terminus of the Grand Trunk
  Pacific railway will be in this vicinity.</p>

         <i>Fauna.</i>—Among the larger mammals are the big-horn or
  mountain sheep (<i>Ovis canadensis</i>), the Rocky Mountain goat
  (<i>Mazama montana</i>), the grizzly bear, moose, woodland caribou,
  black-tailed or mule deer, white-tailed deer, and coyote. All these are
  to be found only on the mainland. The black bear, wolf, puma, lynx,
  wapiti, and Columbian or coast deer are common to parts of both mainland
  and islands. Of marine mammals the most characteristic are the sea-lion,
  fur-seal, sea-otter and harbour-seal. About 340 species of birds are
  known to occur in the province, among which, as of special interest, may
  be mentioned the burrowing owl of the dry, interior region, the <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page599">[v.04
  p.0599]</ph>American magpie, Steller's jay and a true nut-cracker,
  Clark's crow (<i>Picicorvus columbianus</i>). True jays and orioles are
  also well represented. The gallinaceous birds include the large blue
  grouse of the coast, replaced in the Rocky Mountains by the dusky grouse.
  The western form of the "spruce partridge" of eastern Canada is also
  abundant, together with several forms referred to the genus
  <i>Bonasa</i>, generally known as "partridges" or ruffed grouse.
  Ptarmigans also abound in many of the higher mountain regions. Of the
  <i>Anatidae</i> only passing mention need be made. During the spring and
  autumn migrations many species are found in great abundance, but in the
  summer a smaller number remain to breed, chief among which are the teal,
  mallard, wood-duck, spoon-bill, pin-tail, buffle-head, red-head,
  canvas-back, scaup-duck, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Area and Population.</i>—The area of British Columbia is
  357,600 sq. m., and its population by the census of 1901 was 190,000.
  Since that date this has been largely increased by the influx of miners
  and others, consequent upon the discovery of precious metals in the
  Kootenay, Boundary and Atlin districts. Much of this is a floating
  population, but the opening up of the valleys by railway and new lines of
  steamboats, together with the settlements made in the vicinity of the
  Canadian Pacific railway, has resulted in a considerable increase of the
  permanent population. The white population comprises men of many
  nationalities. There is a large Chinese population, the census of 1901
  returning 14,201. The influx of Chinamen has, however, practically
  ceased, owing to the tax of $500 per head imposed by the government of
  the dominion. Many Japanese have also come in. The Japanese are engaged
  chiefly in lumbering and fishing, but the Chinese are found everywhere in
  the province. Great objection is taken by the white population to the
  increasing number of "Mongolians," owing to their competition with whites
  in the labour markets. The Japanese do not appear to be so much disliked,
  as they adapt themselves to the ways of white men, but they are equally
  objected to on the score of cheap labour; and in 1907-1908 considerable
  friction occurred with the Dominion government over the Anti-Japanese
  attitude of British Columbia, which was shown in some rather serious
  riots. In the census of 1901 the Indian population is returned at 25,488;
  of these 20,351 are professing Christians and 5137 are pagans. The
  Indians are divided into very many tribes, under local names, but fall
  naturally on linguistic grounds into a few large groups. Thus the
  southern part of the interior is occupied by the Salish and Kootenay, and
  the northern interior by the Tinneh or Athapackan people. On the coast
  are the Haida, Tsimshian, Kwakiatl, Nootka, and about the Gulf of Georgia
  various tribes related to the Salish proper. There is no treaty with the
  Indians of British Columbia, as with those of the plains, for the
  relinquishment of their title to the land, but the government otherwise
  assists them. There is an Indian superintendent at Victoria, and under
  him are nine agencies throughout the province to attend to the
  Indians—relieving their sick and destitute, supplying them with
  seed and implements, settling their disputes and administering justice.
  The Indian fishing stations and burial grounds are reserved, and other
  land has been set apart for them for agricultural and pastoral purposes.
  A number of schools have been established for their education. They were
  at one time a dangerous element, but are now quiet and peaceable.</p>
      <p>The chief cities are Victoria, the capital, on Vancouver Island; and
  Vancouver on the mainland, New Westminster on the Fraser and Nanaimo on
  Vancouver Island. Rossland and Nelson in West Kootenay, as well as Fernie
  in East Kootenay and Grand Forks in the Boundary district, are also
  places of importance.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Mining.</i>—Mining is the principal industry of British
  Columbia. The country is rich in gold, silver, copper, lead and coal, and
  has also iron deposits. From 1894 to 1904 the mining output increased
  from $4,225,717 to $18,977,359. In 1905 it had reached $22,460,295. The
  principal minerals, in order of value of output, are gold, copper, coal,
  lead and silver. Between 1858—the year of the placer discoveries on
  the Fraser river and in the Cariboo district—and 1882, the placer
  yields were much heavier than in subsequent years, running from one to
  nearly four million dollars annually, but there was no quartz mining.
  Since 1899 placer mining has increased considerably, although the greater
  part of the return has been from lode mining. The Rossland, the Boundary
  and the Kootenay districts are the chief centres of vein-mining, yielding
  auriferous and cupriferous sulphide ores, as well as large quantities of
  silver-bearing lead ores. Ores of copper and the precious metals are
  being prospected and worked also, in several places along the coast and
  on Vancouver Island. The mining laws are liberal, and being based on the
  experience gained in the adjacent mining centres of the Western States,
  are convenient and effective. The most important smelting and reducing
  plants are those at Trail and Nelson in the West Kootenay country, and at
  Grand Forks and Greenwood in the Boundary district. There are also
  numerous concentrating plants. Mining machinery of the most modern types
  is employed wherever machinery is required.</p>
      <p>The province contains enormous supplies of excellent coal, most of
  which are as yet untouched. It is chiefly of Cretaceous age. The
  producing collieries are chiefly on Vancouver Island and on the western
  slope of the Rockies near the Crow's Nest Pass in the extreme
  south-eastern portion of the provinces. Immense beds of high grade
  bituminous coal and semi-anthracite are exposed in the Bulkley Valley,
  south of the Skeena river, not far from the projected line of the Grand
  Trunk Pacific railway. About one-half the coal mined is exported to the
  United States.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Fisheries.</i>—A large percentage of the commerce is derived
  from the sea, the chief product being salmon. Halibut, cod (several
  varieties), oolachan, sturgeon, herring, shad and many other fishes are
  also plentiful, but with the exception of the halibut these have not yet
  become the objects of extensive industries. There are several kinds of
  salmon, and they run in British Columbia waters at different seasons of
  the year. The quinnat or spring salmon is the largest and best table
  fish, and is followed in the latter part of the summer by the sockeye,
  which runs in enormous numbers up the Fraser and Skeena rivers. This is
  the fish preferred for canning. It is of brighter colour, more uniform in
  size, and comes in such quantities that a constant supply can be reckoned
  upon by the canneries. About the mouth of the Fraser river from 1800 to
  2600 boats are occupied during the run. There is an especially large run
  of sockeye salmon in the Fraser river every fourth year, while in the
  year immediately following there is a poor run. The silver salmon or
  cohoe arrives a little later than the sockeye, but is not much used for
  packing except when required to make up deficiencies. The dog-salmon is
  not canned, but large numbers are caught by the Japanese, who salt them
  for export to the Orient. The other varieties are of but little
  commercial importance at present, although with the increasing demand for
  British Columbia salmon, the fishing season is being extended to cover
  the runs of all the varieties of this fish found in the waters of the
  province.</p>
      <p>Great Britain is the largest but not the only market for British
  Columbia salmon. The years vary in productiveness, 1901 having been
  unusually large and 1903 the smallest in eleven years, but the average
  pack is about 700,000 cases of forty-eight 1-lb tins, the greater part of
  all returns being from the Fraser river canneries, the Skeena river and
  the Rivers Inlet coming next in order. There are between 60 and 70
  canneries, of which about 40 are on the banks of <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page600">[v.04 p.0600]</ph>the Fraser
  river. There is urgent need for the enactment of laws restricting the
  catch of salmon, as the industry is now seriously threatened. The fish
  oils are extracted chiefly from several species of dog-fish, and
  sometimes from the basking shark, as well as from the oolachan, which is
  also an edible fish.</p>
      <p>The fur-seal fishery is an important industry, though apparently a
  declining one. Owing to the scarcity of seals and international
  difficulties concerning pelagic sealing in Bering Sea, where the greatest
  number have been taken, the business of seal-hunting is losing favour.
  Salmon fish-hatcheries have been established on the chief rivers
  frequented by these fish. Oysters and lobsters from the Atlantic coast
  have been planted in British Columbia waters.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Timber.</i>—The province is rich in forest growth, and there
  is a steady demand for its lumber in the other parts of Canada as well as
  in South America, Africa, Australia and China. The following is a list of
  some of the more important trees—large leaved maple (<i>Acer
  macrophyllum</i>), red alder (<i>Alnus rubra</i>), western larch
  (<i>Larix occidentalis</i>), white spruce (<i>Picea alba</i>),
  Engellmann's spruce (<i>Picea Engelmanii</i>), Menzies's spruce (<i>Picea
  sitchensis</i>), white mountain pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i>), black pine
  (<i>Pinus murrayana</i>), yellow pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>), Douglas
  fir (<i>Pseudotsuga Douglasii</i>), western white oak (<i>Quercus
  garryana</i>), giant cedar (<i>Thuya gigantea</i>), yellow cypress or
  cedar (<i>Thuya excelsa</i>), western hemlock (<i>Tsuga mertensiana</i>).
  The principal timber of commerce is the Douglas fir. The tree is often
  found 300 ft. high and from 8 to 10ft. in diameter. The wood is tough and
  strong and highly valued for ships' spars as well as for building
  purposes. Red or giant cedar, which rivals the Douglas fir in girth, is
  plentiful, and is used for shingles as well as for interior work. The
  western white spruce is also much employed for various purposes. There
  are about eighty sawmills, large and small, in the province. The amount
  of timber cut on Dominion government lands in 1904 was 22,760,222 ft.,
  and the amount cut on provincial lands was 325,271,568 ft., giving a
  total of 348,031,790 ft. In 1905 the cut on dominion lands exceeded that
  in 1904, while the amount cut on provincial lands reached 450,385,554 ft.
  The cargo shipments of lumber for the years 1904 and 1905 were as

      <p>There is a very large market for British Columbia lumber in the
  western provinces of Canada.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Agriculture.</i>—Although mountainous in character the
  province contains many tracts of good farming land. These lie in the long
  valleys between the mountain ranges of the interior, as well as on the
  lower slopes of the mountains and on the deltas of the rivers running out
  to the coast. On Vancouver Island also there is much good farming land.
  The conditions are in most places best suited to mixed farming; the chief
  crops raised are wheat, oats, potatoes and hay. Some areas are especially
  suited for cattle and sheep raising, among which may be mentioned the
  Yale district and the country about Kamloops. Much attention has been
  given to fruit raising, especially in the Okanagan valley. Apples, plums
  and cherries are grown, as well as peaches, apricots, grapes and various
  small fruits, notably strawberries. All these are of excellent quality.
  Hops are also cultivated. A large market for this fruit is opening up in
  the rapidly growing provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Imports and Exports.</i>—For the year ending June 30th 1905
  the total exports and imports (showing a slight gradual increase on the
  two preceding years) were valued at $16,677,882 and $12,565,019
  respectively. The exports were classified as follows:—Mines,
  $9,777,423; fisheries, $2,101,533; forests, $1,046,718; animals,
  $471,231; agriculture, $119,426; manufactures, $1,883,777; miscellaneous,
  $1,106,643; coin and bullion, $171,131.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Railways.</i>—The Pacific division of the Canadian Pacific
  railway enters British Columbia through the Rocky Mountains on the east
  and runs for about 500 m. across the province before reaching the
  terminus at Vancouver. A branch of the same railway leaves the main line
  at Medicine Hat, and running to the south-west, crosses the Rocky
  Mountains through the Crow's Nest Pass, and thus enters British Columbia
  a short distance north of the United States boundary. This continues
  across the province, running approximately parallel to the boundary as
  far as Midway in what is known as the Boundary district. The line has
  opened up extensive coal fields and crosses a productive mining district.
  On Vancouver Island there are two railways, the Esquimalt &amp; Nanaimo
  railway (78 m.) connecting the coal fields with the southern ports, and
  the Victoria &amp; Sydney railway, about 16 m. in length. The Great
  Northern has also a number of short lines in the southern portion of the
  province, connecting with its system in the United States. In 1905 there
  were 1627m. of railway in the province, of which 1187 were owned or
  controlled by the Canadian Pacific railway.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Shipping.</i>—The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has two
  lines of mail steamer running from Vancouver and Victoria: (l) the
  Empress line, which runs to Japan and China once in three weeks, and (2)
  the Australian line to Honolulu, Fiji and Sydney, once a month. The same
  company also has a line of steamers running to Alaska, as well as a fleet
  of coasting steamers.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Government.</i>—The province is governed by a
  lieutenant-governor, appointed by the governor-general in council for
  five years, but subject to removal for cause, an executive council of
  five ministers, and a single legislative chamber. The executive council
  is appointed by the lieutenant-governor on the advice of the first
  minister, and retains office so long as it enjoys the support of a
  majority of the legislature. The powers of the lieutenant-governor in
  regard to the provincial government are analogous to those of
  governor-general in respect of the dominion government.</p>
      <p>The British North America Act (1867) confederating the colonies,
  defines the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature as distinguished
  from that of the federal parliament, but within its own jurisdiction the
  province makes the laws for its own governance. The act of the
  legislature may be disallowed, within one year of its passage, by the
  governor-general in council, and is also subject to challenge as to its
  legality in the supreme court of Canada or on appeal to the juridical
  committee of the privy council of the United Kingdom. British Columbia
  sends three senators and seven members to the lower house of the federal
  parliament, which sits at Ottawa.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Justice.</i>—There is a supreme court of British Columbia
  presided over by a chief justice and five puisne judges, and there are
  also a number of county courts. In British Columbia the supreme court has
  jurisdiction in divorce cases, this right having been invested in the
  colony before confederation.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Religion and Education.</i>—In 1901 the population was
  divided by creeds as follows: Church of England, 40,687; Methodist,
  25,047; Presbyterian, 34,081; Roman Catholic, 33,639; others, 40,197; not
  stated, 5003; total, 178,654. The educational system of British Columbia
  differs slightly from that of other provinces of Canada. There are three
  classes of schools—common, graded and high—all maintained by
  the government and all free and undenominational. There is only one
  college in the province, the "McGill University College of British
  Columbia" at Vancouver, which is one of the colleges of McGill
  University, whose chief seat is at Montreal. The schools are controlled
  by trustees selected by the ratepayers of each school district, and there
  is a superintendent of education acting under the provincial
  secretary.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Finance.</i>—Under the terms of union with Canada, British
  Columbia receives from the dominion government annually a certain
  contribution, which in 1905 amounted to $307,076. This, with provincial
  taxes on real property, personal property, income tax, sales of public
  land, timber dues, &amp;c., amounted in the year 1905 to $2,920,461. The
  expenditure for the year was $2,302,417. The gross debt of the province
  in 1905 was $13,252,097, with assets of $4,463,869, or a net debt of
  $8,788,228. These assets do not include new legislative buildings or
  other public works. The income tax is on a sliding scale. In 1899 a
  fairly close estimate was made of the capital invested in the province,
  which amounted to $307,385,000 including timber, $100,000,000; railways
  and telegraphs, $47,500,000; mining plant and smelters, $10,500,000;
  municipal assessments, $45,000,000; provincial assessments, $51,500,000;
  in addition to private wealth, $280,000,000. There are branch offices of
  one or more of the Canadian banks in each of the larger towns.</p>

         <i>History.</i>—The discovery of British Columbia was made by
  the Spaniard Perez in 1774. With Cook's visit the geographical
  exploration of the coast began in 1778. Vancouver, in 1792-1794, surveyed
  almost the entire coast of British Columbia with much of that to the
  north and south, for the British government. The interior, about the same
  time, was entered by Mackenzie and traders of the N.W. Company, which in
  1821 became amalgamated with the Hudson's Bay Company. For the next
  twenty-eight years the Hudson's Bay Company ruled this immense territory
  with beneficent despotism. In 1849 Vancouver Island was proclaimed a
  British colony. In 1858, consequent on the discovery of gold and the
  large influx of miners, the mainland territory was erected into a colony
  under the name of British Columbia, and in 1866 this was united with the
  colony of Vancouver Island, under the same name. In 1871 British Columbia
  entered the confederation and became part of the Dominion of Canada,
  sending three senators and six (now seven) members to the House of
  Commons of the federal parliament. One of the conditions under which the
  colony entered the dominion was the speedy construction of the Canadian
  Pacific railway, and in 1876 the non-fulfilment of this promise and the
  apparent indifference of the government at Ottawa to the representations
  of British Columbia created <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page601">[v.04 p.0601]</ph>strained relations, which were
  only ameliorated when the construction of a transcontinental road was
  begun. In subsequent years the founding of the city of Vancouver by the
  C.P.R., the establishment of the first Canadian steamship line to China
  and Japan, and that to Australia, together with the disputes with the
  United States on the subject of pelagic sealing, and the discovery of the
  Kootenay and Boundary mining districts, have been the chief events in the
  history of the province.</p>
