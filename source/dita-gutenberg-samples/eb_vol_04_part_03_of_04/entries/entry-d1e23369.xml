   <title>BROWN, HENRY KIRKE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROWN, HENRY KIRKE--> (1814-1886), American sculptor, was born in
  Leyden, Massachusetts, on the 24th of February 1814. He began to paint
  portraits while quite a boy, studied painting in Boston under Chester
  Harding, learned a little about modelling, and in 1836-1839 spent his
  summers working as a railroad engineer to earn enough to enable him to
  study further. He spent four years (1842-1846) in Italy; but returning to
  New York he remained distinctively American, and was never dominated, as
  were so many of the early American sculptors, by Italian influence. He
  died on the 10th of July 1886 at Newburgh, New York. His equestrian
  statues are excellent, notably that of General Winfield Scott (1874) in
  Washington, D.C., and one of George Washington (1856) in Union Square,
  New York City, which was the second equestrian statue made in the United
  States, following by three years that of Andrew Jackson in Washington by
  Clark Mills (1815-1883). Brown was one of the first in America to cast
  his own bronzes. Among his other works are: Abraham Lincoln (Union
  Square, New York City); Nathanael Greene, George Clinton, Philip Kearny,
  and Richard Stockton (all in the National Statuary Hall, Capitol,
  Washington, D.C.); De Witt Clinton and "The Angel of the Resurrection,"
  both in Greenwood cemetery, New York City; and an "Aboriginal
  Hunter."</p>
      <p>His nephew and pupil, Henry Kirke Bush-Brown (b. 1857), also became
  prominent among American sculptors, his "Buffalo Hunt," equestrian
  statues of Generals Meade and Reynolds at Gettysburg, and "Justinian" in
  the New York appellate court-house, being his chief works.</p>
