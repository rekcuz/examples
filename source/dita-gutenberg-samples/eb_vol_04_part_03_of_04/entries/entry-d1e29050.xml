   <title>BUCEPHALUS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCEPHALUS--> (Gr. <ph outputclass="grk">βουκεφαλος</ph>),
  the favourite Thracian horse of Alexander the Great, which died in 326
  <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph>, either of wounds received in the battle
  on the Hydaspes, or of old age. In commemoration Alexander built the city
  of Bucephala (Boukephala), the site of which is almost certainly to be
  identified with a mound on the bank of the river opposite the modern
  Jhelum.</p>
      <p>See especially Arrian v. 20; other stories in Plutarch, <i>Alex.</i>
  6; Curtius vi. 8. For the identification of Bucephala, Vincent A. Smith,
  <i>Early Hist. of India</i> (2nd ed., 1908), pp. 65, 66 note.</p>
