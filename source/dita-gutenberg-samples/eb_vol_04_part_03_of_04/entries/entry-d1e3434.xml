   <body>
      <p><!--BRICKWORK,--> in building, the term applied to constructions made
  of bricks. The tools and implements employed by the bricklayer
  are:—the trowel for spreading the mortar; the plumb-rule to keep
  the work perpendicular, or in the case of an inclined or battering wall,
  to a regular batter, for the plumb-rule may be made to suit any required
  inclination; the spirit-level to keep the work horizontal, often used in
  conjunction with a straight-edge in order to test a greater length; and
  the gauge-rod with the brick-courses marked on it. The quoins or angles
  are first built up with the aid of the gauge-rod, and the intermediate
  work is kept regular by means of the line and line pins fixed in the
  joints. The raker, jointer, pointing rule and Frenchman are used in
  pointing joints, the pointing staff being held on a small board called
  the hawk. For roughly cutting bricks the large trowel is used; for neater
  work such as facings, the bolster and club-hammer; the cold chisel is for
  general cutting away, and for chases and holes. When bricks require to be
  cut, the work is set out with the square, bevel and compasses. If the
  brick to be shaped is a hard one it is placed on a V-shaped cutting
  block, an incision made where desired with the tin saw, and after the
  bolster and club-hammer have removed the portion of the brick, the
  scutch, really a small axe, is used to hack off the rough parts. For
  cutting soft bricks, such as rubbers and malms, a frame saw with a blade
  of soft iron wire is used, and the face is brought to a true surface on
  the rubbing stone, a slab of Yorkshire stone.</p>
      <p>In ordinary practice a scaffold is carried up with the walls and made
  to rest on them. Having built up as high as he can reach from the ground,
  the scaffolder erects a scaffold with standards, ledgers and putlogs to
  carry the scaffold boards (see <ph outputclass="sc">Scaffold</ph>, <ph outputclass="sc">Scaffolding</ph>). Bricks are carried to the scaffold on a
  hod which holds twenty bricks, or they may be hoisted in baskets or boxes
  by means of a pulley and fall, or may be raised in larger numbers by a
  crane. The mortar is taken up in a hod or hoisted in pails and deposited
  on ledged boards about 3 ft. square, placed on the scaffold at convenient
  distances apart along the line of work. The bricks are piled on the
  scaffold between the mortar boards, leaving a clear way against the wall
  for the bricklayers to move along. The workman, beginning at the extreme
  left of his section, or at a quoin, advances to the right, carefully
  keeping to his line and frequently testing his work with the plumb-rule,
  spirit-level and straight-edge, until he reaches another angle, or the
  end of his section. The pointing is sometimes finished off as the work
  proceeds, but in other cases the joints are left open until the
  completion, when the work is pointed down, perhaps in a different mortar.
  When the wall has reached a height from the scaffold beyond which the
  workman cannot conveniently reach, the scaffolding is raised and the work
  continued in this manner from the new level.</p>

      <p>It is most important that the brickwork be kept perfectly plumb, and
  that every course be perfectly horizontal or level, both longitudinally
  and transversely. Strictest attention should be paid to the levelling of
  the lowest course of footings of a wall, for any irregularity will
  necessitate the inequality being made up with mortar in the courses
  above, thus inducing a liability for the wall to settle unequally, and so
  perpetuate the infirmity. To save the trouble of keeping the plumb-rule
  and level constantly in his hands and yet ensure correct work, the
  bricklayer, on clearing the footings of a wall, builds up six or eight
  courses of bricks at the external angles (see fig. 1), which he carefully
  plumbs and levels across. These form a gauge for the intervening work, a
  line being tightly strained between and fixed with steel pins to each
  angle at a level with the top of the next course to be laid, and with
  this he makes his work range. If, however, the length between the quoins
  be great, the line will of course sag, and it must, therefore, be
  carefully supported at intervals to the proper level. Care must be taken
  to keep the "perpends," or vertical joints, one immediately over the
  other. Having been carried up three or four courses to a level with the
  guidance of the line which is raised course by course, the work should be
  proved with the level and plumb-rule, particularly with the latter at the
  quoins and reveals, as well as over the face. A smart tap with the end of
  the handle of the trowel will suffice to make a brick yield what little
  it may be out of truth, while the work is green, and not injure it. The
  work of an efficient craftsman, however, will need but little
  adjustment.</p>
      <p>For every wall of more than one brick (9 in) thick, two men should be
  employed at the same time, one on the outside and the <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page522">[v.04 p.0522]</ph>other
  inside; one man cannot do justice from one side to even a 14-in. wall.
  When the wall can be approached from one side only, the work is said to
  be executed "overhand." In work circular on plan, besides the level and
  plumb-rule, a gauge mould or template, or a ranging trammel—a rod
  working on a pivot at the centre of the curve, and in length equalling
  the radius—must be used for every course, as it is evident that the
  line and pins cannot be applied to this in the manner just described.</p>
      <p>Bricks should not be merely <i>laid</i>, but each should be placed
  frog upwards, and rubbed and pressed firmly down in such a manner as to
  secure absolute adhesion, and force the mortar into joints. Every brick
  should be well wetted before it is laid, especially in hot dry weather,
  in order to wash off the dust from its surface, and to obtain more
  complete adhesion, and prevent it from absorbing water from the mortar in
  which it is bedded. The bricks are wetted either by the bricklayer
  dipping them in water as he uses them, or by water being thrown or
  sprinkled on them as they lie piled on the scaffold. In bricklaying with
  quick-setting cements an ample use of water is of even more
  importance.</p>
      <p>All the walls of a building that are to sustain the same floors and
  the same roof, should be carried up simultaneously; in no circumstances
  should more be done in one part than can be reached from the same
  scaffold, until all the walls are brought up to the same height. Where it
  is necessary for any reason to leave a portion of the wall at a certain
  level while carrying up the adjoining work the latter should be racked
  back, i.e. left in steps as shown in fig. 7, and not carried up
  vertically with merely the toothing necessary for the bond.</p>

            <alt>Fig. 2.--Section of a Hollow Wall.</alt>
         </image>
      </fig>
      <p>Buildings in exposed situations are frequently built with
  cavity-walls, consisting of the inside or main walls with an outer skin
  <ph outputclass="sidenote">Hollow walls.</ph> usually half a brick thick,
  separated from the former by a cavity of 2 or 3 in. (fig. 2). The two
  walls are tied together at frequent intervals by iron or stoneware ties,
  each having a bend or twist in the centre, which prevents the
  transmission of water to the inner wall. All water, therefore, which
  penetrates the outer wall drops to the base of the cavity, and trickles
  out through gratings provided for the purpose a few inches above the
  ground level. The base of the cavity should be taken down a course or two
  below the level of the damp-proof course. The ties are placed about 3 ft.
  apart horizontally, with 12 or 18 in. vertical intervals; they are about
  8 in. long and ¾ in. wide. It is considered preferable by some architects
  and builders to place the thicker wall on the outside. This course,
  however, allows the main wall to be attacked by the weather, whereas the
  former method provides for its protection by a screen of brickwork. Where
  door and window frames occur in hollow walls, it is of the utmost
  importance that a proper lead or other flashing be built in, shaped so as
  to throw off on each side, clear of the frames and main wall, the water
  which may penetrate the outer shell. While building the wall it is very
  essential to ensure that the cavity and ties be kept clean and free from
  rubbish or mortar, and for this purpose a wisp of straw or a narrow
  board, is laid on the ties where the bricklayer is working, to catch any
  material that may be inadvertently dropped, this protection being raised
  as the work proceeds. A hollow wall tends to keep the building dry
  internally and the temperature equable, but it has the disadvantage of
  harbouring vermin, unless care be taken to ensure their exclusion. The
  top of the wall is usually sealed with brickwork to prevent vermin or
  rubbish finding its way into the cavity. Air gratings should be
  introduced here to allow of air circulating through the cavity; they also
  facilitate drying out after rain.</p>
      <p>Hollow walls are not much used in London for two reasons, the first
  being that, owing to the protection from the weather afforded by
  surrounding buildings, one of the main reasons for their use is gone, and
  the other that the expense is greatly increased, owing to the authorities
  ignoring the outer shell and requiring the main wall to be of the full
  thickness stipulated in schedule I. of London Building Act 1894. Many
  English provincial authorities in determining the thickness of a
  cavity-wall, take the outer portion into consideration.</p>
      <p>In London and the surrounding counties, brickwork is measured by the
  <i>rod</i> of 16½ ft. square, 1½ bricks in thickness. A rod of brickwork
  <ph outputclass="sidenote">Materials and labour.</ph> gauged four courses
  to a foot with bricks 8¾ in. long, 4¼ in. wide, and 2¾ in thick, and
  joints ¼ in. in thickness, will require 4356 bricks, and the number will
  vary as the bricks are above or below the average size, and as the joints
  are made thinner or thicker. The quantity of mortar, also, will evidently
  be affected by the latter consideration, but in London it is generally
  reckoned at 50 cub. ft. for a ¼-in. joint, to 72 cub. ft. for a joint
  ⅜ in. thick. To these figures must be added an allowance of about
  11 cub. ft. if the bricks are formed with frogs or hollows. Bricks weigh
  about 7 lb each; they are bought and sold by the thousand, which quantity
  weighs about 62 cwt. The weight of a rod of brickwork is 13½-15 tons,
  work in cement mortar being heavier than that executed in lime. Seven
  bricks are required to face a sq. ft.; 1 ft. of reduced
  brickwork—1½ bricks thick—will require 16 bricks. The number
  of bricks laid by a workman in a day of eight hours varies considerably
  with the description of work, but on straight walling a man will lay an
  average of 500 in a day.</p>
      <p>The absorbent properties of bricks vary considerably with the kind of
  brick. The ordinary London stock of good quality should <ph outputclass="sidenote">Varieties of bricks.</ph> not have absorbed, after
  twenty-four hours' soaking, more than one-fifth of its bulk. Inferior
  bricks will absorb as much as a third. The Romans were great users of
  bricks, both burnt and sun-dried. At the decline of the Roman empire, the
  art of brickmaking fell into disuse, but after the lapse of some
  centuries it was revived, and the ancient architecture of Italy shows
  many fine examples of brick and terra-cotta work. The scarcity of stone
  in the Netherlands led to the development of a brick architecture, and
  fine examples of brickwork abound in the Low Countries. The Romans seem
  to have introduced brickmaking into England, and specimens of the large
  thin bricks, which they used chiefly as a bond for rubble masonry, may be
  seen in the many remains of Roman buildings scattered about that country.
  During the reigns of the early Tudor kings the art of brickmaking arrived
  at great perfection, and some of the finest known specimens of ornamental
  brickwork are to be found among the work of this period. The rebuilding
  of London after the Great Fire of 1666 gave considerable impetus to
  brickmaking, most of the new buildings being of brick, and a statute was
  passed regulating the number of bricks in the thickness of the walls of
  the several rates of dwelling-houses.</p>
      <p>The many names given to the different qualities of bricks in various
  parts of Great Britain are most confusing, but the following are those
  generally in use:—</p>
      <p>
         <i>Stocks</i>, hard, sound, well-burnt bricks, used for all ordinary
  purposes.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Hard Stocks,</i> sound but over-burnt, used in footings to walls
  and other positions where good appearance is not required.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Shippers</i>, sound, hard-burnt bricks of imperfect shape. Obtain
  their name from being much used as ballast for ships.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Rubbers</i> or <i>Cutters</i>, sandy in composition and suitable
  for cutting with a wire saw and rubbing to shape on the stone slab.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Grizzles</i>, sound and of fair shape, but under-burnt; used for
  inferior work, and in cases where they are not liable to be heavily
  loaded.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Place-bricks</i>, under-burnt and defective; used for temporary
  work.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Chuffs</i>, cracked and defective in shape and badly burnt. <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page523">[v.04
  p.0523]</ph>
         <i>Burrs</i>, lumps which have vitrified or run together in
  the burning; used for rough walling, garden work, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Pressed bricks</i>, moulded under hydraulic pressure, and much used
  for facing work. They usually have a deep frog or hollow on one or both
  horizontal faces, which reduces the weight of the brick and forms an
  excellent key for the mortar.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Blue bricks</i>, chiefly made in South Staffordshire and North
  Wales. They are used in engineering work, and where great compressional
  resistance is needed, as they are vitrified throughout, hard, heavy,
  impervious and very durable. Blue bricks of special shape may be had for
  paving, channelling and coping.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Fire-bricks</i>, withstanding great heat, used in connexion with
  furnaces. They should always be laid with fire-clay in place of lime or
  cement mortar.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Glazed bricks</i>, either salt-glazed or enamelled. The former,
  brown in colour, are glazed by throwing salt on the bricks in the kiln.
  The latter are dipped into a slip of the required colour before being
  burnt, and are used for decorative and sanitary purposes, and where
  reflected light is required.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Moulded bricks</i>, for cornices, string courses, plinths, labels
  and copings. They are made in the different classes to many patterns; and
  on account of their greater durability, and the saving of the labour of
  cutting, are preferable in many cases to rubbers. For sewer work and
  arches, bricks shaped as voussoirs are supplied.</p>
      <p>The strength of brickwork varies very considerably according to the
  kind of brick used, the position in which it is used, the kind and <ph outputclass="sidenote">Strength of brickwork.</ph> quality of the lime or
  cement mortar, and above all the quality of the workmanship. The results
  of experiments with short walls carried out in 1896-1897 by the Royal
  Institute of British Architects to determine the average loads per sq.
  ft. at which crushing took place, may be briefly summarized as follows:
  Stock brickwork in lime mortar crushed under a pressure of 18.63 tons per
  sq. ft., and in cement mortar under 39.29 tons per sq. ft. Gault
  brickwork in lime mortar crushed at 31.14 tons, and in cement mortar at
  51.34 tons. Fletton brickwork in lime crushed under a load of 30.68 tons,
  in cement under 56.25 tons. Leicester red brickwork in lime mortar
  crushed at 45.36 tons per sq. ft., in cement mortar at 83.36 tons.
  Staffordshire blue brick work in lime mortar crushed at 114.34 tons, and
  in cement mortar at 135.43 tons.</p>
      <p>The height of a brick pier should not exceed twelve times its least
  width. The London Building Act in the first schedule prescribes that in
  buildings not public, or of the warehouse class, in no storey shall any
  external or party walls exceed in height sixteen times the thickness. In
  buildings of the warehouse class, the height of these walls shall not
  exceed fourteen times the thickness.</p>
      <p>In exposed situations it is necessary to strengthen the buildings by
  increasing the thickness of walls and parapets, and to provide heavier
  copings and flashings. Special precautions, too, must be observed in the
  fixing of copings, chimney pots, ridges and hips. The greatest wind
  pressure experienced in England may be taken at 56 lb on a sq. ft., but
  this is only in the most exposed positions in the country or on a sea
  front. Forty pounds is a sufficient allowance in most cases, and where
  there is protection by surrounding trees or buildings 28 lb per sq. ft.
  is all that needs to be provided against.</p>
      <p>In mixing mortar, particular attention must be paid to the sand with
  which the lime or cement is mixed. The best sand is that <ph outputclass="sidenote">Mortar.</ph> obtained from the pit, being sharp and
  angular. It is, however, liable to be mixed with clay or earth, which
  must be washed away before the sand is used. Gravel found mixed with it
  must be removed by screening or sifting. River sand is frequently used,
  but is not so good as pit sand on account of the particles being rubbed
  smooth by attrition. Sea sand is objectionable for two reasons; it cannot
  be altogether freed from a saline taint, and if it is used the salt
  attracts moisture and is liable to keep the brickwork permanently damp.
  The particles, moreover, are generally rounded by attrition, caused by
  the movement of the sea, which makes it less efficient for mortar than if
  they retained their original angular forms. Blue or black mortar, often
  used for pointing the joints of external brickwork on account of its
  greater durability, is made by using foundry sand or smith's ashes
  instead of ordinary sand. There are many other substitutes for the
  ordinary sand. As an example, fine stone grit may be used with advantage.
  Thoroughly burnt clay or ballast, old bricks, clinkers and cinders,
  ground to a uniform size and screened from dust, also make excellent
  substitutes.</p>
      <p>Fat limes (that is, limes which are pure, as opposed to "hydraulic"
  limes which are burnt from limestone containing some clay) should not be
  used for mortar; they are slow-setting, and there is a liability for some
  of the mortar, where there is not a free access of air to assist the
  setting, remaining soft for some considerable period, often months, thus
  causing unequal settlement and possibly failure. Grey stone lime is
  feebly hydraulic, and makes a good mortar for ordinary work. It, however,
  decays under the influence of the weather, and it is, therefore,
  advisable to point the external face of the work in blue ash or cement
  mortar, in order to obtain greater durability. It should never be used in
  foundation work, or where exposed to wet. Lias lime is hydraulic, that
  is, it will set firm under water. It should be used in all good class
  work, where Portland cement is not desired.</p>
      <p>Of the various cements used in building, it is necessary only to
  mention three as being applicable to use for mortar. The first of these
  is Portland cement, which has sprung into very general use, not only for
  work where extra strength and durability are required, and for
  underground work, but also in general building where a small extra cost
  is not objected to. Ordinary lime mortar may have its strength
  considerably enhanced by the addition of a small proportion of Portland
  cement. Roman cement is rarely used for mortar, but is useful in some
  cases on account of the rapidity with which it sets, usually becoming
  hard about fifteen minutes after mixing. It is useful in tidal work and
  embankments, and constructions under water. It has about one-third of the
  strength of Portland cement, by which it is now almost entirely
  supplanted. Selenitic cement or lime, invented by Major-General H. Y. D.
  Scott (1822-1883), is lias lime, to which a small proportion of plaster
  of Paris has been added with the object of suppressing the action of
  slaking and inducing quicker setting. If carefully mixed in accordance
  with the instructions issued by the manufacturers, it will take a much
  larger proportion of sand than ordinary lime.</p>
      <p>Lime should be slaked before being made into mortar. The lime is
  measured out, deposited in a heap on a wooden "bank" or platform, and
  after being well watered is covered with the correct proportion of sand.
  This retains the heat and moisture necessary to thorough slaking; the
  time required for this operation depends on the variety of the lime, but
  usually it is from a few hours to one and a half days. If the mixing is
  to be done by hand the materials must be screened to remove any unslaked
  lumps of lime. The occurrence of these may be prevented by grinding the
  lime shortly before use. The mass should then be well "larried,"
  <i>i.e.</i> mixed together with the aid of a long-handled rake called the
  "larry." Lime mortar should be tempered for at least two days, roughly
  covered up with sacks or other material. Before being used it must be
  again turned over and well mixed together. Portland and Roman cement
  mortars must be mixed as required on account of their quick-setting
  properties. In the case of Portland cement mortar, a quantity sufficient
  only for the day's use should be "knocked up," but with Roman cement
  fresh mixtures must be made several times a day, as near as possible to
  the place of using. Cement mortars should never be worked up after
  setting has taken place. Care should be taken to obtain the proper
  consistency, which is a stiff paste. If the mortar be too thick, extra
  labour is involved in its use, and much time wasted. If it be so thin as
  to run easily from the trowel, a longer time is taken in setting, and the
  wall is liable to settle; also there is danger that the lime or cement
  will be killed by the excess of water, or at least have its binding power
  affected. It is not advisable to carry out work when the temperature is
  below freezing point, but in urgent cases bricklaying may be successfully
  done by using unslaked lime mortar. The mortar must be prepared in small
  quantities immediately before being used, so that binding action takes
  place before it cools. When the wall is left at night time the top course
  should be covered up to prevent the penetration of rain into the work,
  which would then be destroyed by the action of frost. Bricks used during
  frosty weather should be quite dry, and those that have been exposed to
  rain or frost should never be employed. The question whether there is any
  limit to bricklayers' work in frost is still an open one. Among the
  members of the Norwegian Society of Engineers and Architects, at whose
  meetings the subject has been frequently discussed, that limit is
  variously estimated at between -6° to -8° Réaumur (18½° to 14° Fahr.) and
  -12° to -15° Réaumur (5° above to 1¾° below zero Fahr.). It has been
  proved by hydraulic tests that good bricklayers' work can be executed at
  the latter minimum. The conviction is held that the variations in the
  opinions held on this subject are attributable to the degree of care
  bestowed on the preparation of the mortar. It is generally agreed,
  however, that from a practical point of view, bricklaying should not be
  carried on at temperatures lower than -8° to -10° Réaumur (14° to 9½°
  Fahr.), for as the thermometer falls the expense of building is greatly
  increased, owing to a larger proportion of lime being required.</p>
      <p>For grey lime mortar the usual proportion is one part of lime to two
  or three parts of sand; lias lime mortar is mixed in similar proportions,
  except for work below ground, when equal quantities of lime and sand
  should be used. Portland cement mortar is usually in the proportions of
  one to three, or five, of sand; good results are obtained with lime
  mortar fortified with cement as follows:—one part slaked lime, one
  part Portland cement, and seven parts sand. Roman cement mortar should
  consist of one or one and a half parts of cement to one part of sand.
  Selenitic lime mortar is usually in the proportions of one to four or
  five, and must be mixed in a particular manner, the lime being first
  ground in water in the mortar mill, and the sand gradually added. Blue or
  black mortar contains equal parts of foundry ashes and lime; but is
  improved by the addition of a proportion of cement. For setting
  fire-bricks fire-clay is always used. Pargetting for rendering inside
  chimney flues is made of one part of lime with three parts of cow dung
  free from straw or litter. No efficient substitute has been found for
  this mixture, which should be used fresh. A mortar that has found
  approval for tall chimney shafts is composed by grinding in a mortar-mill
  one part of blue lias lime with one part each of sand and foundry ashes.
  In the external walls of the Albert Hall the mortar used was one part
  Portland cement, one part grey Burham lime and six parts pit sand. The
  lime was slaked twenty-four hours, and after being mixed <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page524">[v.04 p.0524]</ph>with
  the sand for ten minutes the cement was added and the whole ground for
  one minute; the stuff was prepared in quantities only sufficient for
  immediate use. The by-laws dated 1891, made by the London County Council
  under section 16 of the Metropolis Management and Building Acts Amendment
  Act 1878, require the proportions of lime mortar to be one to three of
  sand or grit, and for cement mortar one to four. Clean soft water only
  should be used for the purpose of making mortar.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Grout</i> is thin liquid mortar, and is legitimately used in gauged
  arches and other work when fine joints are desired. In ordinary work it
  is sometimes used every four or five courses to fill up any spaces that
  may have been inadvertently left between the bricks. This at the best is
  but doing with grout what should be done with mortar in the operation of
  laying the bricks; and filling or flushing up every course with mortar
  requires but little additional exertion and is far preferable. The use of
  grout is, therefore, a sign of inefficient workmanship, and should not be
  countenanced in good work. It is liable, moreover, to ooze out and stain
  the face of the brickwork.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Lime putty</i> is pure slaked lime. It is prepared or "run," as it
  is termed, in a wooden tub or bin, and should be made as long a time as
  possible before being used; at least three weeks should elapse between
  preparation and use.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The pointing of a wall, as previously mentioned, is done either with
  the bricklaying or at the completion of the work. If the <ph outputclass="sidenote">Pointing.</ph> pointing is to be of the same mortar as
  the rest of the work, it would probably greatly facilitate matters to
  finish off the work at one operation with the bricklaying, but where, as
  in many cases, the pointing is required to be executed in a more durable
  mortar, this would be done as the scaffold is taken down at the
  completion of the building, the joints being raked out by the bricklayer
  to a depth of ½ or ¾ in. By the latter method the whole face of the work
  is kept uniform in appearance. The different forms of joints in general
  use are clearly shown in fig. 3. Flat or flush joints (A) are formed by
  pressing the protruding mortar back flush with the face of the brickwork.
  This joint is commonly used for walls intended to be coated with
  distemper or limewhite. The flat joint jointed (two forms, B and C) is a
  development of the flush joint. In order to increase the density and
  thereby enhance the durability of the mortar, a semicircular groove is
  formed along the centre, or one on each side of the joint, with an iron
  jointer and straight-edge. Another form, rarely used, is the keyed joint
  shown at D, the whole width of the joint in this case being treated with
  the curved key. Struck or bevelled, or weathered, joints have the upper
  portion pressed back with the trowel to form a sloping surface, which
  throws off the wet. The lower edge is cut off with the trowel to a
  straight edge. This joint is in very common use for new work. Ignorant
  workmen frequently make the slope in the opposite direction (F), thus
  forming a ledge on the brick; this catches the water, which on being
  frozen rapidly causes the disintegration of the upper portion of the
  brick and of the joint itself. With recessed jointing, not much used, a
  deep shadow may be obtained. This form of joint, illustrated in G, is
  open to very serious objections, for it encourages the soaking of the
  brick with rain instead of throwing off the wet, as it seems the natural
  function of good pointing, and this, besides causing undue dampness in
  the wall, renders it liable to damage by frost. It also leaves the
  arrises of the bricks unprotected and liable to be damaged, and from its
  deep recessed form does not make for stability in the work. Gauged work
  has very thin joints, as shown at H, formed by dipping the side of the
  brick in white lime putty. The sketch I shows a joint raked out and
  filled in with pointing mortar to form a flush joint, or it may be
  finished in any of the preceding forms. Where the wall is to be plastered
  the joints are either left open or raked out, or the superfluous mortar
  may be left protruding as shown at J. By either method an excellent key
  is obtained, to which the rendering firmly adheres. In tuck pointing (K)
  the joints are raked out and stopped, i.e. filled in flush with mortar
  coloured to match the brickwork. The face of the wall is then rubbed over
  with a soft brick of the same colour, or the work may be coloured with
  pigment. A narrow groove is then cut in the joints, and the mortar
  allowed to set. White lime putty is next filled into the groove, being
  pressed on with a jointing tool, leaving a white joint ⅛ to ¼ in.
  wide, and with a projection of about 1/16 in. beyond the face of the
  work. This method is not a good or a durable one, and should only be
  adopted in old work when the edges of the bricks are broken or irregular.
  In bastard tuck pointing (L), the ridge, instead of being in white lime
  putty, is formed of the stopping mortar itself.</p>
      <p>Footings, as will be seen on reference to fig. 1, are the wide courses
  of brickwork at the base or foot of a wall. They serve to spread <ph outputclass="sidenote">Footings.</ph> the pressure over a larger area of
  ground, offsets 2¼ in. wide being made on each side of the wall until a
  width equal to double the thickness of the wall is reached. Thus in a
  wall 13½ in. (1½ bricks) thick, this bottom course would be 2 ft. 3 in.
  (3 bricks) wide. It is preferable for greater strength to double the
  lowest course. The foundation bed of concrete then spreading out an
  additional 6 in. on each side brings the width of the surface bearing on
  the ground to 3 ft. 3 in. The London Building Act requires the projection
  of concrete on each side of the brickwork to be only 4 in., but a
  projection of 6 in. is generally made to allow for easy working. Footings
  should be built with hard bricks laid principally as headers; stretchers,
  if necessary, should be placed in the middle of the wall.</p>

      <p>Bond in brickwork is the arrangement by which the bricks of every
  course cover the joints of those in the course below it, and so <ph outputclass="sidenote">Bonding.</ph> tend to make the whole mass or
  combination of bricks act as much together, or as dependently one upon
  another, as possible. The workmen should be strictly supervised as they
  proceed with the work, for many failures are due to their ignorance or
  carelessness in this particular. The object of bonding will be understood
  by reference to fig. 4. Here it is evident from the arrangement of the
  bricks that any weight placed on the topmost brick (<i>a</i>) is carried
  down and borne alike in every course; in this way the weight on each
  brick is distributed over an area increasing with every course. But this
  forms a longitudinal bond only, which cannot extend its influence beyond
  the width of the brick; and a wall of one brick and a half, or two
  bricks, thick, built in this manner, would in effect consist of three or
  four half brick thick walls acting independently of each other. If the
  bricks were turned so as to show their short sides or ends in front
  instead of their long ones, certainly a compact wall of a whole brick
  thick, instead of half a brick, would be produced, and while the
  thickness of the wall would be double, the longitudinal bond would be
  shortened by one-half: a wall of any great thickness built in this manner
  would necessarily be composed of so many independent one-brick walls. To
  produce a transverse and yet preserve a true longitudinal bond, the
  bricks are laid in a definite arrangement of stretchers and headers.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>In "English bond" (fig. 5), rightly considered the most perfect in
  use, the bricks are laid in alternate courses of headers and stretchers,
  thus combining the advantages of the two previous modes of arrangement. A
  reference to fig. 5 will show how the process of bonding is pursued in a
  wall one and a half bricks in thickness, and how the quoins are formed.
  In walls which are a multiple of a whole brick, the appearance of the
  same course is similar on the elevations of the front and back faces, but
  in walls where an odd half brick must be used to make up the thickness,
  as is the case in the illustration, the appearance of the opposite sides
  of a course is inverted. The example illustrates the principle of English
  bond; thicker walls are constructed in the same manner by an extension of
  the same methods. It will be observed that portions of a brick have to be
  inserted near a vertical end or a quoin, in order to start the regular
  bond. These portions equal a half header in width, and are called queen
  closers; they are placed next to the first header. A three-quarter brick
  is obviously as available for this purpose as a header and closer
  combined, but the latter method is preferred because by the use of it
  uniformity of appearance is preserved, and whole bricks are retained on
  the returns. King closers are used at rebated openings formed in walls in
  Flemish bond, and by reason of the greater width of the back or "tail,"
  add strength to the work. They are cut on the splay so that the front end
  is half the width of a header and one side half the length of the brick.
  An example of their use will be seen in fig. 15. In walls of almost all
  thicknesses above 9 in., except in the <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page525">[v.04 p.0525]</ph>English bond,
  to preserve the transverse and yet not destroy the longitudinal bond, it
  is frequently necessary to use half bricks. It may be taken as a general
  rule that a brick should never be cut if it can be worked in whole, for a
  new joint is thereby created in a construction, the difficulty of which
  consists in obviating the debility arising from the constant recurrence
  of joints. Great insistence must be laid on this point, especially at the
  junctions of walls, where the admission of closers already constitutes a
  weakness which would only be increased by the use of other bats or
  fragments of bricks.</p>

         </image>
      </fig>
      <p>Another method of bonding brickwork, instead of placing the bricks in
  alternate courses of headers and stretchers, places them alternately as
  headers and stretchers in the same course, the appearance of the course
  being the same on each face. This is called "Flemish bond." Closers are
  necessary to this variety of bond. From fig. 6 it will be seen that,
  owing to the comparative weakness of the transverse tie, and the numbers
  of half bricks required to be used and the thereby increased number of
  joints, this bond is not so perfect nor so strong as English. The
  arrangements of the face joints, however, presenting in Flemish bond a
  neater appearance than in English bond, it is generally selected for the
  external walls of domestic and other buildings where good effect is
  desirable. In buildings erected for manufacturing and similar purposes,
  and in engineering works where the greatest degree of strength and
  compactness is considered of the highest importance, English bond should
  have the preference.</p>
      <p>A compromise is sometimes made between the two above-mentioned bonds.
  For the sake of appearance the bricks are laid to form Flemish bond on
  the face, while the backing is of English bond, the object being to
  combine the best features of the two bonds. Undoubtedly the result is an
  improvement on Flemish bond, obviating as it does the use of bats in the
  interior of the wall. This method of bonding is termed "single Flemish
  bond," and is shown in fig. 7.</p>
      <p>In stretching bond, which should only be used for walls half a brick
  in thickness, all the bricks are laid as stretchers, a half brick being
  used in alternate courses to start the bond. In work curved too sharply
  on plan to admit of the use of stretchers, and for footings, projecting
  mouldings and corbels, the bricks are all laid as headers, i.e. with
  their ends to the front, and their length across the thickness of the
  wall. This is termed "heading bond."</p>

      <p>In thick walls, three bricks thick and upwards, a saving of labour is
  effected without loss of strength, by the adoption of "herring bone" or
  "diagonal bond" in the interior of the wall, the outer faces of the wall
  being built in English and Flemish bond. This mode should not be had
  recourse to for walls of a less thickness than 27 in., even that being
  almost too thin to admit of any great advantage from it.</p>
      <p>Hoop-iron, about 1½ in. wide and 1/16 in. thick, either galvanized or
  well tarred and sanded to retard rusting, is used in order to obtain
  additional longitudinal tie. The customary practice is to use one strip
  of iron for each half-brick in thickness of the wall. Joints at the
  angles, and where necessary in the length, are formed by bending the ends
  of the strips so as to hook together. A patent stabbed iron now on the
  market is perforated to provide a key for the mortar.</p>
      <p>A difficulty often arises in bonding when facing work with bricks of a
  slightly different size from those used in "backing," as it is
  technically termed. As it is, of course, necessary to keep all brickwork
  in properly levelled courses, a difference has to be made in the
  thickness of the mortar joints. Apart from the extra labour involved,
  this obviously is detrimental to the stability of the wall, and is apt to
  produce unequal settlement and cracking. Too much care cannot be taken to
  obtain both facing and backing bricks of equal size.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Dishonest bricklayers do not hesitate, when using for the face of a
  wall bricks of a quality superior to those used for the interior, to use
  "snapped headers," that is cutting the heading bricks in halves, one
  brick thus serving the purposes of two as regards outward appearance.
  This is a most pernicious practice, unworthy of adoption by any craftsman
  of repute, for a skin of brickwork 4½ in. thick is thus carried up with a
  straight mortar joint behind it, the proper bonding with the back of the
  wall by means of headers being destroyed.</p>
      <p>American building acts describe the kind of bond to be used for
  ordinary walls, and the kind for faced walls. Tie courses also require an
  extra thickness where walls are perforated with over 30% of flues.</p>
      <p>The importance for sanitary and other reasons of keeping walls dry is
  admitted by all who have observed the deleterious action of damp upon a
  building.</p>
      <p>Walls are liable to become damp, (1) by wet rising up the wall from
  the earth; (2) by water soaking down from the top of the <ph outputclass="sidenote">Prevention of damp.</ph> wall; (3) by rain being
  driven on to the face by wind. Dampness from the first cause may be
  prevented by the introduction of damp-proof courses or the construction
  of dry areas; from the second by means of a coping of stone, cement or
  other non-porous material; and from the third by covering the exterior
  with impervious materials or by the adoption of hollow walls.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>After the footings have been laid and the wall has been brought up to
  not less than 6 in. above the finished surface of the ground, and
  previous to fixing the plate carrying the ground floor, there should
  always be introduced a course of some damp-proof material to prevent the
  rise of moisture from the soil. There are several forms of damp-proof
  course. A very usual one is a double layer of roofing slates laid in neat
  Portland cement (fig. 8), the joints being well lapped. A course or two
  of Staffordshire blue bricks in cement is excellent where heavy weights
  have to be considered. Glazed stoneware perforated slabs about 2 in.
  thick are specially made for use as damp-proof courses. Asphalt (fig. 9)
  recently has come into great favour with architects; a layer ½ or ¾ in.
  thick is a good protection against damp, and not likely to crack should a
  settlement occur, but in hot weather it is liable to squeeze out at the
  joints under heavy weights. Felt covered with bitumen is an excellent
  substitute for asphalt, and is not liable to crack or squeeze out. Sheet
  lead is efficient, but very costly and also somewhat liable to squeezing.
  A damp-proof course has been introduced consisting of a thin sheet of
  lead sandwiched between layers of asphalt. Basement storeys to be kept
  dry require, besides the damp-proof course horizontally in the wall, a
  horizontal course, usually of asphalt, in the thickness of the floor, and
  also a vertical damp-proof course from a level below that of the floor to
  about 6 in. above the level of the ground, either built in the thickness
  of the wall or rendered on the outside between the wall and the
  surrounding earth (fig. 10).</p>
      <p>By means of dry areas or air drains (figs. 11 and 12), a hollow <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page526">[v.04
  p.0526]</ph>space 9 in. or more in width is formed around those
  portions of the walls situated below the ground, the object being to
  prevent them from coming into contact with the brickwork of the main
  walls and so imparting its moisture to the building. Arrangements should
  be made for keeping the area clear of vermin and for ventilating and
  draining it. Dry areas, being far from sanitary, are seldom adopted now,
  and are being superseded by asphalt or cement applied to the face of the
  wall.</p>

      <p>The by-laws dated 1891, made by the London County Council under
  section 16 of the Metropolis Management and Buildings Acts Amendment Act
  1878, require that "every wall of a house or building shall have a damp
  course composed of materials impervious to moisture approved by the
  district surveyor, extending throughout its whole thickness at the level
  of not less than 6 in. below the level of the lowest floor. Every
  external wall or enclosing wall of habitable rooms or their appurtenances
  or cellars which abuts against the earth shall be protected by materials
  impervious to moisture to the satisfaction of the district surveyor..."
  "The top of every party-wall and parapet-wall shall be finished with one
  course of hard, well-burnt bricks set on edge, in cement, or by a coping
  of any other waterproof and fire-resisting material, properly
  secured."</p>
      <p>Arches are constructions built of wedge-shaped blocks, which by reason
  of their shape give support one to another, and to the <ph outputclass="sidenote">Arches.</ph> super-imposed weight, the resulting load
  being transmitted through the blocks to the abutments upon which the ends
  of the arch rest. An arch should be composed of such materials and
  designed of such dimensions as to enable it to retain its proper shape
  and resist the crushing strain imposed upon it. The abutments also must
  be strong enough to take safely the thrust of the weighted arch, as the
  slightest movement in these supports will cause deflection and failure.
  The outward thrust of an arch decreases as it approaches the semicircular
  form, but the somewhat prevalent idea that in the latter form no
  thrusting takes place is at variance with fact.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Arches in brickwork may be classed under three heads: plain arches,
  rough-cut and gauged. Plain arches are built of uncut bricks, and since
  the difference between the outer and inner periphery of the arch requires
  the parts of which an arch is made up to be wedge-formed, which an
  ordinary brick is not, the difference must be made in mortar, with the
  result that the joints become wedge-shaped. This obviously gives an
  objectionable inconsistency of material in the arch, and for this reason
  to obtain greatest strength it is advisable to build these arches in
  independent rings of half-brick thickness. The undermost rings should
  have thin joints, those of each succeeding ring being slightly thickened.
  This prevents the lowest ring from settling while those above remain in
  position, which would cause an ugly fissure. In work of large span
  bonding blocks or "lacing courses" should be built into the arch, set in
  cement and running through its thickness at intervals, care being taken
  to introduce the lacing course at a place where the joints of the various
  rings coincide. Stone blocks in the shape of a voussoir (fig. 14) may be
  used instead. Except for these lacing courses hydraulic lime mortar
  should be used for large arches, on account of its slightly accommodating
  nature.</p>
      <p>Rough-cut arches are those in which the bricks are roughly cut with an
  axe to a wedge form; they are used over openings, such as doors and
  windows, where a strong arch of neat appearance is desired. The joints
  are usually made equal in width to those of the ordinary brickwork.
  Gauged arches are composed of specially made soft bricks, which are cut
  and rubbed to gauges or templates so as to form perfectly fitting
  voussoirs. Gauging is, of course, equally applicable to arches and
  walling, as it means no more than bringing every brick exactly to a
  certain form by cutting and rubbing. Gauged brickwork is set in lime
  putty instead of common mortar; the finished joints should not be more
  than 1/32 in. wide. To give stability the sides of the voussoirs are
  gauged out hollow and grouted in Portland cement, thus connecting each
  brick with the next by a joggle joint. Gauged arches, being for the most
  part but a half-brick in thickness on the soffit and not being tied by a
  bond to anything behind them—for behind them is the lintel with
  rough discharging arch over, supporting the remaining width of the
  wall—require to be executed with great care and nicety. It is a
  common fault with workmen to rub the bricks thinner behind than before to
  lessen the labour required to obtain a very fine face joint. This
  practice tends to make the work bulge outwards; it should rather be
  inverted if it be done at all, though the best work is that in which the
  bricks are gauged to exactly the same thickness at the back as at the
  front. The same fault occurs when a gauged arch is inserted in an old
  wall, on account of the difficulty of filling up with cement the space
  behind the bricks.</p>
      <p>The bond of an arch obtains its name from the arrangement of headers
  and stretchers on its soffit. The under side of an arch built in English
  bond, therefore, will show the same arrangement as the face of a wall
  built in English bond. If the arch is in Flemish the soffit presents the
  same appearance as the elevation of a wall built in that bond.</p>
      <p>It is generally held that the building of wood into brickwork <ph outputclass="sidenote">Plates.</ph> should as far as is possible be avoided.
  Wall plates of wood are, however, necessary where wood joists are used,
  and where these plates may not be supported on corbels of projecting
  brickwork or iron they must be let flush into the wall, taking the place
  of a course of bricks. They form a uniform bed for the joists, to which
  easy fixing is obtained. The various modes adopted for resting and fixing
  the ends of joists on walls are treated in the article <ph outputclass="sc">Carpentry</ph>.</p>

      <p>Lintels, which may be of iron, steel, plain or reinforced concrete, or
  stone, are used over square-headed openings instead of or in conjunction
  with arches. They are useful to preserve the square form and receive the
  joiners' fittings, but except when made of steel or of concrete
  reinforced with steel bars, they should have relieving arches turned
  immediately over them (Fig.15).</p>
      <p>"Fixing bricks" were formerly of wood of the same size as the ordinary
  brick, and built into the wall as required for fixing joinery. Owing to
  their liability to shrinkage and decay, their use is now practically
  abandoned, their place being taken by bricks of coke-breeze concrete,
  which do not shrink or rot and hold fast nails or screws driven into
  them. Another method often adopted for <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page527">[v.04 p.0527]</ph>providing a
  fixing for joinery is to build in wood slips the thickness of a joint and
  4½ in. wide. When suitable provision for fixing has not been made, wood
  plugs are driven into the joints of the bricks. Great care must be taken
  in driving these in the joints of reveals or at the corners of walls, or
  damage may be done.</p>
      <p>The name "brick-ashlar" is given to walls faced with ashlar stonework
  backed in with brickwork. Such constructions are liable in an aggravated
  degree to the unequal settling and its attendant evils pointed out as
  existing in walls built with different qualities of bricks. The outer
  face is composed of unyielding stone with few and very thin joints, which
  perhaps do not occupy more than a hundredth part of its height, while the
  back is built up of bricks with about one-eighth its height composed of
  mortar joints, that is, of a material that by its nature and manner of
  application must both shrink in drying and yield to pressure. To obviate
  this tendency to settle and thus cause the bulging of the face or failure
  of the wall, the mortar used should be composed of Portland cement and
  sand with a large proportion of the former, and worked as stiff as it
  conveniently can be. In building such work the stones should be in height
  equal to an exact number of brick courses. It is a common practice in
  erecting buildings with a facing of Kentish rag rubble to back up the
  stonework with bricks. Owing to the great irregularity of the stones,
  great difficulty is experienced in obtaining proper bond between the two
  materials. Through bonding stones or headers should be frequently built
  in, and the whole of the work executed in cement mortar to ensure
  stability.</p>
      <p>Not the least important part of the bricklayer's art is the formation
  of chimney and other flues. Considerable skill is required in <ph outputclass="sidenote">Chimneys and flues.</ph> gathering-over properly above
  the fireplace so as to conduct the smoke into the smaller flue, which
  itself requires to be built with precision, so that its capacity may not
  vary in different parts. Bends must be made in gradual curves so as to
  offer the least possible resistance to the up-draught, and at least one
  bend of not less than 60° should be formed in each flue to intercept
  down-draughts. Every fireplace must have a separate flue. The collection
  of a number of flues into a "stack" is economical, and tends to increase
  the efficiency of the flues, the heat from one flue assisting the
  up-draught in those adjoining it. It is also desirable from an aesthetic
  point of view, for a number of single flue chimneys sticking up from
  various parts of the roof would appear most unsightly. The architects of
  the Elizabethan and later periods were masters of this difficult art of
  treating a stack or stacks as an architectural feature. The shaft should
  be carried well above the roof, higher, if possible, than adjacent
  buildings, which are apt to cause down-draught and make the chimney
  smoke. When this is found impossible, one of the many forms of patent
  chimney-pots or revolving cowls must be adopted. Each flue must be
  separated by smoke-proof "withes" or divisions, usually half a brick in
  thickness; connexion between them causes smoky chimneys. The size of the
  flue for an ordinary grate is 14×9 in.; for a kitchen stove 14×14 in. The
  outer wall of a chimney stack may with advantage be made 9 in. thick.
  Fireclay tubes, rectangular or circular in transverse section, are
  largely used in place of the pargetting; although more expensive than the
  latter they have the advantage in point of cleanliness and durability.
  Fireplaces generally require more depth than can be provided in the
  thickness of the wall, and therefore necessitate a projection to contain
  the fireplace and flues, called the "chimney breast." Sometimes,
  especially when the wall is an external one, the projection may be made
  on the back, thus allowing a flush wall in the room and giving more space
  and a more conveniently-shaped room. The projection on the outside face
  of the wall may be treated as an ornamental feature. The fireplace
  opening is covered by a brick relieving arch, which is fortified by
  wrought-iron bar from ½ to ¾ in. thick and 2 to 3 in. wide. It is usually
  bent to a "camber," and the brick arch built upon it naturally takes the
  same curve. Each end is "caulked," that is, split longitudinally and
  turned up and down. The interior of a chimney breast behind the stove
  should always be filled in solid with concrete or brickwork. The flooring
  in the chimney opening is called the "hearth"; the back hearth covers the
  space between the jambs of the chimney breast, and the front hearth rests
  upon the brick "trimmer arch" designed to support it. The hearth is now
  often formed in solid concrete, supported on the brick wall and fillets
  fixed to the floor joists, without any trimmer arch and finished in neat
  cement or glazed tiles instead of stone slabs.</p>
      <p>Tall furnace chimneys should stand as separate constructions,
  unconnected with other buildings. If it is necessary to bring other work
  close up, a straight joint should be used. The shaft of the chimney will
  be built "overhand," the men working from the inside. Lime mortar is
  used, cement being too rigid to allow the chimney to rock in the wind.
  Not more than 3 ft. in height should be erected in one day, the work of
  necessity being done in small portions to allow the mortar to set before
  it is required to sustain much weight. The bond usually adopted is one
  course of headers to four of stretchers. Scaffolding is sometimes erected
  outside for a height of 25 or 30 ft., to facilitate better pointing,
  especially where the chimney is in a prominent position. The brickwork at
  the top must, according to the London Building Act, be 9 in. thick (it is
  better 14 in. in shafts over 100 ft. high), increasing half a brick in
  thickness for every additional 20 ft. measured downwards. "The shaft
  shall taper gradually from the base to the top at the rate of at least 2½
  in. in 10 ft. of height. The width of the base of the shaft if square
  shall be at least one-tenth of the proposed height of the shaft, or if
  round or any other shape, then one-twelfth of the height. Firebricks
  built inside the lower portion of the shaft shall be provided, as
  additional to and independent of the prescribed thickness of brickwork,
  and shall not be bonded therewith." The firebrick lining should be
  carried up from about 25 ft. for ordinary temperatures to double that
  height for very great ones, a space of 1½ to 3 in. being kept between the
  lining and the main wall. The lining itself is usually 4½ in. thick. The
  cap is usually of cast iron or terra-cotta strengthened with iron bolts
  and straps, and sometimes of stone, but the difficulty of properly fixing
  this latter material causes it to be neglected in favour of one of the
  former. (See a paper by F.J. Bancroft on "Chimney Construction," which
  contains a tabulated description of nearly sixty shafts, <i>Proc. Civ.
  and Mech. Eng. Soc.</i>, December 1883.)</p>
      <p>The work of laying bricks or tiles as paving falls to the lot of the
  bricklayer. Paving formed of ordinary bricks laid flat or on their <ph outputclass="sidenote">Brick paving.</ph> edges was once in general use, but
  is now almost abandoned in favour of floors of special tiles or cement
  paving, the latter being practically non-porous and therefore more
  sanitary and cleaner. Special bricks of extremely hard texture are made
  for stable and similar paving, having grooves worked on the face to
  assist drainage and afford good foothold. A bed of concrete 6 in. thick
  is usually provided under paving, or when the bricks are placed on edge
  the concrete for external paving may be omitted and the bricks bedded in
  sand, the ground being previously well rammed. The side joints of the
  bricks are grouted in with lime or cement. Dutch clinkers are small, hard
  paving bricks burned at a high temperature and of a light yellow colour;
  they are 6 in. long, 3 in. wide, 1½ in. thick. A variety of paving tile
  called "oven tiles" is of similar material to the ordinary red brick, and
  in size is 10 or 12 in. square and 1 to 2 in. thick. An immense variety
  of ornamental paving and walling tiles is now manufactured of different
  colours, sizes and shapes, and the use of these for lining sculleries,
  lavatories, bathrooms, provision shops, &amp;c., makes for cleanliness
  and improved sanitary conditions. Besides, however, being put to these
  uses, tiles are often used in the ornamentation of buildings, externally
  as well as internally.</p>
      <p>Mosaic work is composed of small pieces of marble, stone, glass or
  pottery, laid as paving or wall lining, usually in some ornamental
  pattern or design. A firm bed of concrete is required, the pieces of <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page528">[v.04
  p.0528]</ph>material being fixed in a float of cement about half or
  three-quarters of an inch thick. Roman mosaic is formed with cubes of
  marble of various colours pressed into the float. A less costly paving
  may be obtained by strewing irregularly-shaped marble chips over the
  floated surface: these are pressed into the cement with a plasterer's
  hand float, and the whole is then rolled with an iron roller. This is
  called "terazzo mosaic." In either the Roman or terazzo method any
  patterns or designs that are introduced are first worked in position, the
  ground-work being filled in afterwards. For the use of cement for paving
