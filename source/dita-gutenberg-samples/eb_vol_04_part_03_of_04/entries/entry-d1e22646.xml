      <p><!--BROSCH, MORITZ--> (1829-1907), German historian, was born at
  Prague on the 7th of April 1829, was educated at Prague and Vienna, and
  became a journalist. Later he devoted himself to historical study, and he
  died on the 14th of July 1907 at Venice, where he had resided for over
  thirty years. To the series <i>Geschichte der europäischen Staaten</i>
  Brosch contributed <i>England 1509-1550</i> (6 vols., Gotha, 1884-1899),
  a continuation of the work of J.M. Lappenberg and R. Pauli, and <i>Der
  Kirchenstaat</i> (Gotha, 1880-1882). He gave further proof of his
  interest in English history by writing <i>Lord Bolingbroke und die Whigs
  und Tories seiner Zeit</i> (Frankfort, 1883), and <i>Oliver Cromwell und
  die puritanische Revolution</i> (Frankfort, 1886). He also wrote
  <i>Julius II. und die Gründung des Kirchenstaats</i> (Gotha, 1878), while
  one of his last pieces of work was to contribute a chapter on "The height
  of the Ottoman power" to vol. iii. of the <i>Cambridge Modern
  History</i>.</p>
