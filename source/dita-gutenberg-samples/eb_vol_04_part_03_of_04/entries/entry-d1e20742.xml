   <title>BROME, ALEXANDER</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROME, ALEXANDER--> (1620-1666), English poet, was by profession
  an attorney, and was the author of many drinking songs and of satirical
  verses in favour of the Royalists and against the Rump. He published in
  1661 <i>Songs and other Poems</i>, containing songs on various subjects,
  followed by a series of political songs; ballads, epistles, elegies and
  epitaphs; epigrams and translations. Izaak Walton wrote an introductory
  eclogue for this volume in praise of the writer, and his gaiety and wit
  won for him the title of the "English Anacreon" in Edward Phillips's
  <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i>. Brome published in 1666 a translation of Horace
  by himself and others, and was the author of a comedy entitled <i>The
  Cunning Lovers</i> (1654). He also edited two volumes of Richard Brome's
  plays.</p>
