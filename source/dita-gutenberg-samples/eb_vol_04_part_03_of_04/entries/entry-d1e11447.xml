   <title>BRIDGETT, THOMAS EDWARD</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIDGETT, THOMAS EDWARD--> (1829-1899), Roman Catholic priest and
  historical writer, was born at Derby on the 20th of January 1829. He was
  brought up a Baptist, but in his sixteenth year joined the Church of
  England. In 1847 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, with the
  intention of taking orders. Being unable to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine
  Articles he could not take his degree, and in 1850 became a Roman
  Catholic, soon afterwards joining the Congregation of the Redemptorists.
  He went through his novitiate at St Trond in Belgium, and after a course
  of five years of theological study at Wittem, in Holland, was ordained
  priest. He returned to England in 1856, and for over forty years led an
  active life as a missioner in England and Ireland, preaching in over 80
  missions and 140 retreats to the <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page558">[v.04 p.0558]</ph>clergy and to
  nuns. His stay in Limerick was particularly successful, and he founded a
  religious confraternity of laymen which numbered 5000 members. Despite
  his arduous life as a priest, Bridgett found time to produce literary
  works of value, chiefly dealing with the history of the Reformation in
  England; among these are <i>The Life of Blessed John Fisher, Bishop of
  Rochester</i> (1888); <i>The Life and Writings of Sir Thomas More</i>
  (1890); <i>History of the Eucharist in Great Britain</i> (2 vols., 1881);
  <i>Our Lady's Dowry</i> (1875, 3rd ed. 1890). He died at Clapham on the
  17th of February 1899.</p>

  Bridgett</i>, by C. Ryder (London, 1906).</p>
