   <title>BUCHANAN, GEORGE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCHANAN, GEORGE--> (1506-1582), Scottish humanist, was born in
  February 1506. His father, a younger son of an old family, was the
  possessor of the farm of Moss, in the parish of Killearn, Stirlingshire,
  but he died at an early age, leaving his widow and children in poverty.
  His mother, Agnes Heriot, was of the family of the Heriots of Trabroun,
  Haddingtonshire, of which George Heriot, founder of Heriot's hospital,
  was also a member. Buchanan is said to have attended Killearn school, but
  not much is known of his early education. In 1520 he was sent by his
  uncle, James Heriot, to the university of Paris, where, as he tells us in
  an autobiographical sketch, he devoted himself to the writing of verses
  "partly by liking, partly by compulsion (that being then the one task
  prescribed to youth)." In 1522 his uncle died, and Buchanan being thus
  unable to continue longer in Paris, returned to Scotland. After
  recovering from a severe illness, he joined the French auxiliaries who
  had been brought over by John Stewart, duke of Albany, and took part in
  an unsuccessful inroad into England (see the account in his <i>Hist. of
  Scotland</i>). In the following year he entered the university of St
  Andrews, where he graduated B.A. in 1525. He had gone there chiefly for
  the purpose of attending the celebrated John Major's lectures on logic;
  and when that teacher removed to Paris, Buchanan followed him in 1526. In
  1527 he graduated B.A., and in 1528 M.A. at Paris. Next year he was
  appointed regent, or professor, in the college of Sainte-Barbe, and
  taught there for upwards of three years. In 1529 he was elected
  Procurator of the "German Nation" in the university of Paris, and was
  re-elected four times in four successive months. He resigned his
  regentship in 1531, and in 1532 became tutor to Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd earl
  of Cassilis, with whom he returned to Scotland about the beginning of
  1537.</p>
      <p>At this period Buchanan was content to assume the same attitude
  towards the Church of Rome that Erasmus maintained. He did not repudiate
  its doctrines, but considered himself free to criticize its practice.
  Though he listened with interest to the arguments of the Reformers, he
  did not join their ranks before 1553. His first production in Scotland,
  when he was in Lord Cassilis's household in the west country, was the
  poem <i>Somnium</i>, a satirical attack upon the Franciscan friars and
  monastic life generally. This assault on the monks was not displeasing to
  James V., who engaged Buchanan as tutor to one of his natural <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page715">[v.04
  p.0715]</ph>sons, Lord James Stewart (not the son who was afterwards
  the regent Murray), and encouraged him to a still more daring effort. In
  these circumstances the poems <i>Palinodia</i> and <i>Franciscanus &amp;
  Fratres</i> were written, and, although they remained unpublished for
  many years, it is not surprising that the author became an object of
  bitterest hatred to the order and their friends. Nor was it yet a safe
  matter to assail the church. In 1539 there was a bitter persecution of
  the Lutherans, and Buchanan among others was arrested. He managed to
  effect his escape and with considerable difficulty made his way to London
  and thence to Paris. In Paris, however, he found his enemy, Cardinal
  David Beaton, who was there as an ambassador, and on the invitation of
  André de Gouvéa, proceeded to Bordeaux. Gouvéa was then principal of the
  newly founded college of Guienne at Bordeaux, and by his exertions
  Buchanan was appointed professor of Latin. During his residence here
  several of his best works, the translations of <i>Medea</i> and
  <i>Alcestis</i>, and the two dramas, <i>Jephthes (sive Votum)</i> and
  <i>Baptistes (sive Calumnia)</i>, were completed. Montaigne was
  Buchanan's pupil at Bordeaux and acted in his tragedies. In the essay
  <i>Of Presumption</i> he classes Buchanan with Aurat, Béza, de L'Hopital,
  Montdore and Turnebus, as one of the foremost Latin poets of his time.
  Here also Buchanan formed a lasting friendship with Julius Caesar
  Scaliger; in later life he won the admiration of Joseph Scaliger, who
  wrote an epigram on Buchanan which contains the couplet, famous in its
  day:—</p>
      <fig outputclass="poem">
         <lines>
      "Imperii fuerat Romani Scotia limes;

      Romani eloquii Scotia limes erit?"

    </lines>
      </fig>
      <p>In 1542 or 1543 he returned to Paris, and in 1544 was appointed regent
  in the college of Cardinal le Moine. Among his colleagues were the
  renowned Muretus and Turnebus.</p>
      <p>In 1547 Buchanan joined the band of French and Portuguese humanists
  who had been invited by André de Gouvéa to lecture in the Portuguese
  university of Coimbra. The French mathematician Élie Vinet, and the
  Portuguese historian, Jeronimo de Osorio, were among his colleagues;
  Gouvéa, called by Montaigne <i>le plus grand principal de France</i>, was
  rector of the university, which had reached the summit of its prosperity
  under the patronage of King John III. But the rectorship had been coveted
  by Diogo de Gouvéa, uncle of André and formerly head of Sainte-Barbe. It
  is probable that before André's death at the end of 1547 Diogo had urged
  the Inquisition to attack him and his staff; up to 1906, when the records
  of the trial were first published in full, Buchanan's biographers
  generally attributed the attack to the influence of Cardinal Beaton, the
  Franciscans, or the Jesuits, and the whole history of Buchanan's
  residence in Portugal was extremely obscure.</p>
      <p>A commission of inquiry was appointed in October 1549 and reported in
  June 1550. Buchanan and two Portuguese, Diogo de Teive and Joāo da
  Costa (who had succeeded to the rectorship), were committed for trial.
  Teive and Costa were found guilty of various offences against public
  order, and the evidence shows that there was ample reason for a judicial
  inquiry. Buchanan was accused of Lutheran and Judaistic practices. He
  defended himself with conspicuous ability, courage and frankness,
  admitting that some of the charges were true. About June 1551 he was
  sentenced to abjure his errors, and to be imprisoned in the monastery of
  Sāo Bento in Lisbon. Here he was compelled to listen to edifying
  discourses from the monks, whom he found "not unkind but ignorant." In
  his leisure he began to translate the Psalms into Latin verse. After
  seven months he was released, on condition that he remained in Lisbon;
  and on the 28th of February 1552 this restriction was annulled. Buchanan
  at once sailed for England, but soon made his way to Paris, where in 1553
  he was appointed regent in the college of Boncourt. He remained in that
  post for two years, and then accepted the office of tutor to the son of
  the Maréchal de Brissac. It was almost certainly during this last stay in
  France, where Protestantism was being repressed with great severity by
  Francis I., that Buchanan ranged himself on the side of the
  Calvinists.</p>
      <p>In 1560 or 1561 he returned to Scotland, and in April 1562 we find him
  installed as tutor to the young queen Mary, who was accustomed to read
  Livy with him daily. Buchanan now openly joined the Protestant, or
  Reformed Church, and in 1566 was appointed by the earl of Murray
  principal of St Leonard's College, St Andrews. Two years before he had
  received from the queen the valuable gift of the revenues of Crossraguel
  Abbey. He was thus in good circumstances, and his fame was steadily
  increasing. So great, indeed, was his reputation for learning and
  administrative capacity that, though a layman, he was made moderator of
  the general assembly in 1567. He had sat in the assemblies from 1563.</p>
      <p>Buchanan accompanied the regent Murray into England, and his
  <i>Detectio</i> (published in 1572) was produced to the commissioners at
  Westminster. In 1570, after the assassination of Murray, he was appointed
  one of the preceptors of the young king, and it was through his tuition
  that James VI. acquired his scholarship. While discharging the functions
  of royal tutor he also held other important offices. He was for a short
  time director of chancery, and then became lord privy seal, a post which
  entitled him to a seat in the parliament. He appears to have continued in
  this office for some years, at least till 1579. He died on the 28th of
  September 1582.</p>
      <p>His last years had been occupied with two of his most important works.
  The first was the treatise <i>De Jure Regni apud Scotos</i>, published in
  1579. In this famous work, composed in the form of a dialogue, and
  evidently intended to instil sound political principles into the mind of
  his pupil, Buchanan lays down the doctrine that the source of all
  political power is the people, that the king is bound by those conditions
  under which the supreme power was first committed to his hands, and that
  it is lawful to resist, even to punish, tyrants. The importance of the
  work is proved by the persistent efforts of the legislature to suppress
  it during the century following its publication. It was condemned by act
  of parliament in 1584, and again in 1664; and in 1683 it was burned by
  the university of Oxford. The second of his larger works is the history
  of Scotland, <i>Rerum Scoticarum Historia</i>, completed shortly before
  his death (1579), and published in 1582. It is of great value for the
  period personally known to the author, which occupies the greater portion
  of the book. The earlier part is based, to a considerable extent, on the
  legendary history of Boece. Buchanan's purpose was to "purge" the
  national history "of sum Inglis lyis and Scottis vanite" (<i>Letter to
  Randolph</i>), but he exaggerated his freedom from partisanship and
  unconsciously criticized his work when he said that it would "content few
  and displease many."</p>
      <p>Buchanan is one of Scotland's greatest scholars. For mastery over the
  Latin language he has seldom been surpassed by any modern writer. His
  style is not rigidly modelled upon that of any classical author, but has
  a certain freshness and elasticity of its own. He wrote Latin as if it
  had been his mother tongue. But in addition to this perfect command over
  the language, Buchanan had a rich vein of poetical feeling, and much
  originality of thought. His translations of the Psalms and of the Greek
  plays are more than mere versions; the smaller satirical poems abound in
  wit and in happy phrase; his two tragedies, <i>Baptistes</i> and
  <i>Jephthes</i>, have enjoyed from the first an undiminished European
  reputation for academic excellence. In addition to the works already
  named, Buchanan wrote in prose <i>Chamaeleon</i>, a satire in the
  vernacular against Maitland of Lethington, first printed in 1711; a Latin
  translation of Linacre's Grammar (Paris, 1533); <i>Libettus de
  Prosodia</i> (Edinburgh, 1640); and <i>Vita ab ipso scripta biennio ante
  mortem</i> (1608), edited by R. Sibbald (1702). His other poems are
  <i>Fratres Fraterrimi</i>, <i>Elegiae</i>, <i>Silvae</i>, two sets of
  verses entitled <i>Hendecasyllabon Liber</i> and <i>Iambon Liber</i>;
  three books of <i>Epigrammata</i>; a book of miscellaneous verse; <i>De
  Sphaera</i> (in five books), suggested by the poem of Joannes de
  Sacrobosco, and intended as a defence of the Ptolemaic theory against the
  new Copernican view.</p>
      <p>There are two editions of Buchanan's works:—(<i>a</i>)
  <i>Georgii Buchanani Scoti, Poetarum sui seculi facile principis, Opera
  Omnia</i>, in two vols. fol., edited by Ruddiman (Edinburgh, Freebairn,
  1715); (b) edited by Burman, 4to, 1725. The <i>Vernacular Writings</i>,
  <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page716">[v.04
  p.0716]</ph>consisting of the <i>Chamaeleon</i> (<i>u.s.</i>), a tract
  on the Reformation of St Andrews University, <i>Ane Admonitioun to the
  Trew Lordis</i>, and two letters, were edited for the Scottish Text
  Society by P. Hume Brown. The principal biographies are:—David
  Irving, <i>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of George Buchanan</i>
  (Edinburgh,1807 and 1817); P. Hume Brown, <i>George Buchanan, Humanist
  and Reformer</i> (Edinburgh, 1890), <i>George Buchanan and his Times</i>
  (Edinburgh, 1906); Rev. D. Macmillan, <i>George Buchanan, a Biography</i>
  (Edinburgh, 1906). Buchanan's quatercentenary was celebrated at different
  centres in Scotland in 1906, and was the occasion of several encomia and
  studies. The most important of these are: <i>George Buchanan: Glasgow
  Quatercentenary Studies</i> (Glasgow, 1906), and <i>George Buchanan, a
  Memoir</i>, edited by D.A. Millar (St Andrews, 1907). A verse translation
  of the <i>Baptistes</i>, entitled <i>Tyrannicall-Government
  Anatomized</i> (1642), has been attributed to Milton; its authorship is
  discussed in the <i>Glasgow Quatercentenary Studies</i>. The records of
  Buchanan's trial, discovered by the Portuguese historian, G.J.C.
  Henriques, were published by him under the title <i>George Buchanan in
  the Lisbon Inquisition. The Records of his Trial, with a Translation
  thereof into English, Facsimiles of some of the Papers, and an
  Introduction</i> (Lisbon, 1906).</p>
