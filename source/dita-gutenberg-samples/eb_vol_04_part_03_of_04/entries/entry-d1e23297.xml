   <body>
      <p><!--BROWN, FRANCIS--> (1849- ), American Semitic scholar, was born in
  Hanover, New Hampshire, on the 26th of December 1849, the son of Samuel
  Gilman Brown (1813-1885), president of Hamilton College from 1867 to
  1881, and the grandson of Francis Brown (1784-1820), whose removal from
  the presidency of Dartmouth College and later restoration were incidental
  to the famous "Dartmouth College case." The younger Francis graduated
  from Dartmouth in 1870 and from the Union Theological Seminary in 1877,
  and then studied in Berlin. In 1879 he became instructor in biblical
  philology at the Union Theological Seminary, in 1881 an associate
  professor of the same subject, and in 1890 professor of Hebrew and
  cognate languages.<xref href="#d1e23297/Footnote_171" type="fn"><!--[1]--></xref> Dr Brown's published works have
  won him honorary degrees from the universities of Glasgow and Oxford, as
  well as from Dartmouth and Yale; they are, with the exception of <i>The
  Christian Point of View</i> (1902; with Profs. A. C. McGiffert and G. W.
  Knox), almost purely linguistic and lexical, and include <i>Assyriology:
  its Use and Abuse in Old Testament Study</i> (1885), and the important
  revision of Gesenius, undertaken with S. R. Driver and C. A. Briggs, <i>A
  Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament</i> (1891-1905).</p>

  succeeded Charles Cuthbert Hall (1852-1908) as president of the
  seminary.</fn>
