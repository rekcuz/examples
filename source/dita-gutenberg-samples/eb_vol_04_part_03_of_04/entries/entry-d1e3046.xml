   <title>BRIBERY</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIBERY--> (from the O. Fr. <i>briberie</i>, begging or vagrancy,
  <i>bribe</i>, Mid. Lat. <i>briba</i>, signifying a piece of bread given
  to beggars; the Eng. "bribe" has passed through the meanings of alms,
  blackmail and extortion, to gifts received or given in order to influence
  corruptly). The public offence of bribery may be defined as the offering
  or giving of payment in some shape or form that it may be a motive in the
  performance of functions for which the proper motive ought to be a
  conscientious sense of duty. When this is superseded by the sordid
  impulses created by the bribe, a person is said to be corrupted, and thus
  corruption is a term sometimes held equivalent to bribery. The offence
  may be divided into two great classes—the one where a person
  invested with power is induced by payment to use it unjustly; the other,
  where power is obtained by purchasing the suffrages of those who can
  impart it. It is a natural propensity, removable only by civilization or
  some powerful counteracting influence, to feel that every element of
  power is to be employed as much as possible for the owner's own behoof,
  and that its benefits should be conferred not on those who best deserve
  them, but on those who will pay most for them. Hence judicial corruption
  is an inveterate vice of imperfect civilization. There is, perhaps no
  other crime on which the force of law, if unaided by public opinion and
  morals, can have so little influence; for in other crimes, such as
  violence or fraud, there is generally some person immediately injured by
  the act, who can give his aid in the detection of the offender, but in
  the perpetration of the offence of bribery all the immediate parties
  obtain what they desire, and are satisfied.</p>
      <p>The purification of the bench from judicial bribery has been gradual
  in most of the European countries. In France it received an impulse in
  the 16th century from the high-minded chancellor, Michel de L'Hôpital. In
  England judicial corruption has been a crime of remarkable rarity.
  Indeed, with the exception of a statute of 1384 (repealed by the Statute
  Law Revision Act 1881) there has been no legislation relating to judicial
  bribery. The earliest recorded case was that of Sir William Thorpe, who
  in 1351 was fined and removed from office for accepting bribes. Other
  celebrated cases were those of Michael de la Pole, chancellor of England,
  in 1387; Lord Chancellor Bacon in 1621; Lionel Cranfield, earl of
  Middlesex, in 1624; and Sir Thomas Parker, 1st earl of Macclesfield, in
  1725. In Scotland for some years after the Revolution the bench was not
  without a suspicion of interested partiality; but since the beginning of
  the 19th century, at least, there has been in all parts of the empire a
  perfect reliance on its purity. The same may be said of the higher class
  of ministerial officers. There is no doubt that in the period from the
  Revolution to the end of Queen Anne's reign, when a speaker of the House
  of Commons was expelled for bribery, and the great Marlborough could not
  clear his character from pecuniary dishonesty, there was much corruption
  in the highest official quarters. The level of the offence of official
  bribery has gradually descended, until it has become an extremely rare
  thing for the humbler officers connected with the revenue to be charged
  with it. It has had a more lingering existence with those who, because
  their power is more of a constitutional than an official character, have
  been deemed less responsible to the public. During Walpole's
  administration there is no doubt that members of parliament were paid in
  cash for votes; and the memorable saying, that every man has his price,
  has been preserved as a characteristic indication of his method of
  government. One of the forms in which administrative corruption is most
  difficult of eradication is the appointment to office. It is sometimes
  maintained that the purity which characterizes the administration of
  justice is here unattainable, because in giving a judgment there is but
  one form in which it can be justly given, but when an office has to be
  filled many people may be equally fitted for it, and personal motives
  must influence a choice. It very rarely happens, however, that direct
  bribery is supposed to influence such appointments. It does not appear
  that bribery was conspicuous in England until, in the early part of the
  18th century, constituencies had thrown off the feudal dependence which
  lingered among them; and, indeed, it is often said, that bribery is
  essentially the defect of a free people, since it is the sale of that
  which is taken from others without payment.</p>
      <p>In English law bribery of a privy councillor or a juryman (see <ph outputclass="sc">Embracery</ph>) is punishable as a misdemeanour, as is the
  taking of a bribe by any judicial or ministerial officer. The buying and
  selling of public offices is also regarded at common law as a form of
  bribery. By the Customs Consolidation Act 1876, any officer in the
  customs service is liable to instant dismissal and a penalty of £500 for
  taking a bribe, and any person offering or promising a bribe or reward to
  an officer to neglect his duty or conceal or connive at any act by which
  the customs may be evaded shall forfeit the sum of £200. Under the Inland
  Revenue Regulations Act 1890, the bribery of commissioners, collectors,
  officers or other persons employed in relation to the Inland Revenue
  involves a fine of £500. The Merchant Shipping Act 1894, ss. 112 and 398,
  makes provision for certain offences in the nature of bribery. Bribery
  is, by the Extradition Act 1906, <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page517">[v.04 p.0517]</ph>an extraditable
  offence. Administrative corruption was dealt with in the Public Bodies'
  Corrupt Practices Act 1889. The public bodies concerned are county
  councils, town or borough councils, boards, commissioners, select
  vestries and other bodies having local government, public health or poor
  law powers, and having for those purposes to administer rates raised
  under public general acts. The giving or receiving, promising, offering,
  soliciting or agreeing to receive any gift, fee, loan or advantage by any
  person as an inducement for any act or forbearance by a member, officer
  or servant of a public body in regard to the affairs of that body is made
  a misdemeanour in England and Ireland and a crime and offence in
  Scotland. Prosecution under the act requires the consent of the attorney
  or solicitor-general in England or Ireland and of the lord advocate in
  Scotland. Conviction renders liable to imprisonment with or without hard
  labour for a term not exceeding two years, and to a fine not exceeding
  £500, in addition to or in lieu of imprisonment. The offender may also be
  ordered to pay to the public body concerned any bribe received by him; he
  may be adjudged incapable for seven years of holding public office,
  <i>i.e.</i> the position of member, officer or servant of a public body;
  and if already an officer or servant, besides forfeiting his place, he is
  liable at the discretion of the court to forfeit his right to
  compensation or pension. On a second conviction he may be adjudged
  forever incapable of holding public office, and for seven years incapable
  of being registered or of voting as a parliamentary elector, or as an
  elector of members of a public body. An offence under the act may be
  prosecuted and punished under any other act applicable thereto, or at
  common law; but no person is to be punished twice for the same offence.
  Bribery at political elections was at common law punishable by indictment
  or information, but numerous statutes have been passed dealing with it as
  a "corrupt practice." In this sense, the word is elastic in meaning and
  may embrace any method of corruptly influencing another for the purpose
  of securing his vote (see <ph outputclass="sc">Corrupt Practices</ph>).
  Bribery at elections of fellows, scholars, officers and other persons in
  colleges, cathedral and collegiate churches, hospitals and other
  societies was prohibited in 1588-1589 by statute (31 Eliz. c. 6). If a
  member receives any money, fee, reward or other profit for giving his
  vote in favour of any candidate, he forfeits his own place; if for any
  such consideration he resigns to make room for a candidate, he forfeits
  double the amount of the bribe, and the candidate by or on whose behalf a
  bribe is given or promised is incapable of being elected on that
  occasion. The act is to be read at every election of fellows, &amp;c.,
  under a penalty of £40 in case of default. By the same act any person for
  corrupt consideration presenting, instituting or inducting to an
  ecclesiastical benefice or dignity forfeits two years' value of the
  benefice or dignity; the corrupt presentation is void, and the right to
  present lapses for that turn to the crown, and the corrupt presentee is
  disabled from thereafter holding the same benefice or dignity; a corrupt
  institution or induction is void, and the patron may present. For a
  corrupt resignation or exchange of a benefice the giver and taker of a
  bribe forfeit each double the amount of the bribe. Any person corruptly
  procuring the ordaining of ministers or granting of licenses to preach
  forfeits £40, and the person so ordained forfeits £10 and for seven years
  is incapacitated from holding any ecclesiastical benefice or
  promotion.</p>
      <p>In the United States the offence of bribery is very severely dealt
  with. In many states, bribery or the attempt to bribe is made a felony,
  and is punishable with varying terms of imprisonment, in some
  jurisdictions it may be with a period not exceeding ten years. The
  offence of bribery at elections is dealt with on much the same lines as
  in England, voiding the election and disqualifying the offender from
  holding any office.</p>
      <p>Bribery may also take the form of a secret commission (<i>q.v.</i>), a
  profit made by an agent, in the course of his employment, without the
  knowledge of his principal.</p>
