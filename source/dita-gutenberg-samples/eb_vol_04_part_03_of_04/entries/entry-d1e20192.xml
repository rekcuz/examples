   <body>
      <p><!--BRODY,--> a town of Austria, in Galicia, 62 m. E. of Lemberg by
  rail. Pop. (1900) 17,360, of which about two-thirds are Jews. It is
  situated near the Russian frontier, and has been one of the most
  important commercial centres in Galicia, especially for the trade with
  Russia. But since 1879, when its charter as a free commercial city was
  withdrawn, its trade has also greatly diminished. Brody was created a
  town in 1684, and was raised to the rank of a free commercial city in
  1779.</p>
