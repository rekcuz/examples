   <title>BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICA</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICA-->, the general name given to the British
  protectorates in South Central Africa north of the Zambezi river, but
  more particularly to a large territory lying between 8° 25′ S. on
  Lake Tanganyika and 17° 6′ S. on the river Shiré, near its
  confluence with the Zambezi, and between 36° 10′ E. (district of
  Mlanje) and 26° 30′ E. (river Luengwe-Kafukwe). Originally the term
  "British Central Africa" was applied by Sir H.H. Johnston to all the
  territories under British influence north of the Zambezi which were
  formerly intended to be under one administration; but the course of
  events having prevented the connexion of Barotseland (see <ph outputclass="sc">Barotse</ph>) and the other Rhodesian territories with the
  more direct British administration north of the Zambezi, the name of
  British Central Africa was confined officially (in 1893) to the British
  protectorate on the Shiré and about Lake Nyasa. In 1907 the official
  title of the protectorate was changed to that of Nyasaland Protectorate,
  while the titles "North Eastern Rhodesia" and "North Western Rhodesia"
  (Barotseland) have been given to the two divisions of the British South
  Africa Company's territory north of the Zambezi. The western boundary,
  however, of the territory here described has been taken to be a line
  drawn from near the source of the Lualaba on the southern boundary of
  Belgian Congo to the western source of the Luanga river, and thence the
  course of the Luanga to its junction with the Luengwe-Kafukwe, after
  which the main course of the Kafukwe delimits the territory down to the
  Zambezi. Thus, besides the Nyasaland Protectorate and North Eastern
  Rhodesia, part of North Western Rhodesia is included, and for the whole
  of this region British Central Africa is the most convenient
  designation.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Physical Features.</i>—Within these limits we have a
  territory of about 250,000 sq. m., which includes two-thirds of Lake
  Nyasa, the south end of Lake Tanganyika, more than half Lake Mweru, and
  the whole of Lake Bangweulu, nearly the whole courses of the rivers Shiré
  and Luangwa (or Loangwa), the whole of the river Chambezi (the most
  remote of the headwaters of the river Congo), the right or east bank of
  the Luapula (or upper Congo) from its exit from Lake Bangweulu to its
  issue from the north end of Lake Mweru; also the river Luanga and the
  whole course of the Kafue or Kafukwe.<xref href="#d1e14828/Footnote_101" type="fn"><!--[1]--></xref> Other lesser sheets of water
  included within the limits of this territory are the Great Mweru Swamp,
  between Tanganyika and Mweru, Moir's Lake (a small mountain
  tarn—possibly a crater lake—lying between the Luangwa and the
  Luapula), Lake Malombe (on the upper Shiré), and the salt lake Chilwa
  (wrongly styled Shirwa, being the Bantu word <i>Kilwa</i>), which lies on
  the borders of the Portuguese province of Moçambique. The southern border
  of this territory is the north bank of the Zambezi from the confluence of
  the Kafukwe to that of the Luangwa at Zumbo. Eastwards of Zumbo, British
  Central Africa is separated from the river Zambezi by the Portuguese
  possessions; nevertheless, considerably more than two-thirds of the
  country lies within the Zambezi basin, and is included within the
  subordinate basins of Lake Nyasa and of the rivers Luangwa and
  Luengwe-Kafukwe. The remaining portions drain into the basins of the
  river Congo and of Lake Tanganyika, and also into the small lake or
  half-dried swamp called Chilwa, which at the present time has no outlet,
  though in past ages it probably emptied itself into the Lujenda river,
  and thence into the Indian Ocean.</p>
      <p>As regards orographical features, much of the country is high plateau,
  with an average altitude of 3500 ft. above sea-level. Only a very minute
  portion of its area—the country along the banks of the river
  Shiré—lies at anything like a low elevation; though the Luangwa
  valley may not be more than about 900 ft. above sea-level. Lake Nyasa
  lies at an elevation of 1700 ft. above the sea, is about 350 m. long,
  with a breadth varying from 15 to 40 m. Lake Tanganyika is about 2600 ft.
  above sea-level, with a length of about 400 m. and an average breadth of
  nearly 40 m. Lake Mweru and Lake Bangweulu are respectively 3000 and 3760
  ft. above sea-level; Lake Chilwa is 1946 ft. in altitude. The highest
  mountain found within the limits previously laid down is Mount Mlanje, in
  the extreme south-eastern corner of the protectorate. This remarkable and
  picturesque mass is an isolated "chunk" of the Archean plateau, through
  which at a later date there has been a volcanic outburst of basalt. The
  summit and sides of this mass exhibit several craters. The highest peak
  of Mlanje reaches an altitude of 9683 ft. (In German territory, near the
  north end of Lake Nyasa, and close to the British frontier, is Mount
  Rungwe, the altitude of which exceeds 10,000 ft.) Other high mountains
  are Mounts Chongone and Dedza, in Angoniland, which reach an altitude of
  7000 ft., and points on the Nyika Plateau and in the Konde Mountains to
  the north-west of Lake Nyasa, which probably exceed a height of 8000 ft.
  There are also Mounts Zomba (6900 ft.) and Chiradzulu (5500 ft.) in the
  Shiré Highlands. The principal plateaus or high ridges are (1) the Shiré
  Highlands, a clump of mountainous country lying between the river Shiré,
  the river Ruo, Lake Chilwa and the south end of Lake Nyasa; (2)
  Angoniland—a stretch of elevated country to the west of Lake Nyasa
  and the north-west of the river <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page596">[v.04 p.0596]</ph>Shiré; (3) the Nyika Plateau,
  which lies to the north of Angoniland; and (4) the Nyasa-Tanganyika
  Plateau, between the basin of the river Luangwa, the vicinity of
  Tanganyika and the vicinity of Lake Mweru (highest point, 7000-8000 ft.).
  Finally may be mentioned the tract of elevated country between Lake
  Bangweulu and the river Luapula, and between Lake Bangweulu and the basin
  of the Luangwa; and also the Lukinga (Mushinga) or Ugwara Mountains of
  North Western Rhodesia, which attain perhaps to altitudes of 6000 ft.</p>
      <p>The whole of this part of Africa is practically without any stretch of
  desert country, being on the whole favoured with an abundant rainfall.
  The nearest approach to a desert is the rather dry land to the east and
  north-east of Lake Mweru. Here, and in parts of the lower Shiré district,
  the annual rainfall probably does not exceed an average of 35 in.
  Elsewhere, in the vicinity of the highest mountains, the rainfall may
  attain an average of 75 in., in parts of Mount Mlanje possibly often
  reaching to 100 in. in the year. The average may be put at 50 in. per
  annum, which is also about the average rainfall of the Shiré Highlands,
  that part of British Central Africa which at present attracts the
  greatest number of European settlers.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Geology.</i>—The whole formation is Archean and Primary (with
  a few modern plutonic outbursts), and chiefly consists of granite,
  felspar, quartz, gneiss, schists, amphibolite and other Archean rocks,
  with Primary sandstones and limestones in the basin of Lake Nyasa (a
  great rift depression), the river Shiré, and the regions within the
  northern watershed of the Zambezi river. Sandstones of Karroo age occur
  in the basin of the Luangwa (N.E. Rhodesia). There are evidences of
  recent volcanic activity on the summit of the small Mlanje plateau (S.E.
  corner of the protectorate: here there are two extinct craters with a
  basaltic outflow), and at the north end of Lake Nyasa and the eastern
  edge of the Tanganyika plateau. Here there are many craters and much
  basalt, or even lava; also hot springs.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Metals and Minerals.</i>—Gold has been found in the Shiré
  Highlands, in the hills along the Nyasa-Zambezi waterparting, and in the
  mountainous region west of Lake Nyasa; silver (galena, silver-lead) in
  the hills of the Nyasa-Zambezi waterparting; lead in the same district;
  graphite in the western basin of Lake Nyasa; copper (pyrites and pure
  ore) in the west Nyasa region and in the hills of North Western and North
  Eastern Rhodesia; iron ore almost universally; mica almost universally;
  coal occurs in the north and west Nyasa districts (especially in the
  Karroo sandstones of the Rukuru valley), and perhaps along the
  Zambezi-Nyasa waterparting; limestone in the Shiré basin; malachite in
  south-west Angoniland and North Western Rhodesia; and perhaps petroleum
  in places along the Nyasa-Zambezi waterparting. (See also <ph outputclass="sc">Rhodesia</ph>.)</p>
      <p>
         <i>Flora</i>.—No part of the country comes within the forest
  region of West Africa. The whole of it may be said to lie within the
  savannah or park-like division of the continent. As a general rule, the
  landscape is of a pleasing and attractive character, well covered with
  vegetation and fairly well watered. Actual forests of lofty trees,
  forests of a West African type, are few in number, and are chiefly
  limited to portions of the Nyika, Angoniland and Shiré Highlands
  plateaus, and to a few nooks in valleys near the south end of Tanganyika.
  Patches of forest of tropical luxuriance may still be seen on the slopes
  of Mounts Mlanje and Chiradzulu. On the upper plateaus of Mount Mlanje
  there are forests of a remarkable conifer (<i>Widdringtonia whytei</i>),
  a relation of the cypress, which in appearance resembles much more the
  cedar, and is therefore wrongly styled the "Mlanje cedar." This tree is
  remarkable as being the most northern form of a group of yew-like
  conifers confined otherwise to South Africa (Cape Colony). Immense areas
  in the lower-lying plains are covered by long, coarse grass, sometimes
  reaching 10 ft. in height. Most of the West African forest trees are
  represented in British Central Africa. A full list of the known flora has
  been compiled by Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer and his assistants at Kew, and is
  given in the first and second editions of Sir H. H. Johnston's work on
  British Central Africa. Amongst the principal vegetable products of the
  country interesting for commercial purposes may be mentioned tobacco
  (partly native varieties and partly introduced); coffee (wild coffee is
  said to grow in some of the mountainous districts, but the actual coffee
  cultivated by the European settlers has been introduced from abroad);
  rubber—derived chiefly from the various species of
  <i>Landolphia</i>, <i>Ficus</i>, <i>Clitandra</i>, <i>Carpodinus</i> and
  <i>Conopharygia</i>, and from other apocynaceous plants; the
  <i>Strophanthus</i> pod (furnishing a valuable drug); ground-nuts
  (<i>Arachis</i> and <i>Voandzeia</i>); the cotton plant; all African
  cultivated cereals (<i>Sorghum</i>, <i>Pennisetum</i>, maize, rice,
  wheat—cultivated chiefly by Europeans—and <i>Eleusine</i>);
  and six species of palms—the oil palm on the north-west (near Lake
  Nyasa, at the south end of Tanganyika and on the Luapula), the
  <i>Borassus</i> and <i>Hyphaene</i>, <i>Phoenix</i> (or wild date),
  <i>Raphia</i> and the coco-nut palm. The last named was introduced by
  Arabs and Europeans, and is found on Lake Nyasa and on the lower Shiré.
  Most of the European vegetables have been introduced, and thrive
  exceedingly well, especially the potato. The mango has also been
  introduced from India, and has taken to the Shiré Highlands as to a
  second home. Oranges, lemons and limes have been planted by Europeans and
  Arabs in a few districts. European fruit trees do not ordinarily
  flourish, though apples are grown to some extent at Blantyre. The vine
  hitherto has proved a failure. Pineapples give the best result among
  cultivated fruit, and strawberries do well in the higher districts. In
  the mountains the native wild brambles give blackberries of large size
  and excellent flavour. The vegetable product through which this
  protectorate first attracted trade was coffee, the export of which,
  however, has passed through very disheartening fluctuations. In
  1905-1906, 773,919 lb of coffee (value £16,123) were exported; but during
  this twelve months the crop of cotton—quite a newly developed
  product, rose to 776,621 lb, from 285,185 lb in 1904-1905. An equally
  marked increase in tobacco and ground-nuts (<i>Arachis</i>) has taken
  place. Beeswax is a rising export.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Fauna.</i>—The fauna is on the whole very rich. It has
  affinities in a few respects with the West African forest region, but
  differs slightly from the countries to the north and south by the absence
  of such animals as prefer drier climates, as for instance the oryx
  antelopes, gazelles and the ostrich. There is a complete blank in the
  distribution of this last between the districts to the south of the
  Zambezi and those of East Africa between Victoria Nyanza and the Indian
  Ocean. The giraffe is found in the Luanga valley; it is also met with in
  the extreme north-east of the country. The ordinary African rhinoceros is
  still occasionally, but very rarely, seen in the Shiré Highlands, The
  African elephant is fairly common throughout the whole territory. Lions
  and leopards are very abundant; the zebra is still found in great
  numbers, and belongs to the Central African variety of Burchell's zebra,
  which is completely striped down to the hoofs, and is intermediate in
  many particulars between the true zebra of the mountains and Burchell's
  zebra of the plains. The principal antelopes found are the sable and the
  roan (<i>Hippotragus</i>), five species of <i>Cobus</i> or waterbuck (the
  puku, the Senga puku, the lechwe, Crawshay's waterbuck and the common
  waterbuck); the pallah, tsessébe (<i>Damaliscus</i>), hartebeest,
  brindled gnu (perhaps two species), several duykers (including the large
  <i>Cephalophus sylvicultrix</i>), klipspringer, oribi, steinbok and
  reedbuck. Among tragelaphs are two or more bushbucks, the inyala, the
  water tragelaph (<i>Limnotragus selousi</i>), the kudu and Livingstone's
  eland. The only buffalo is the common Cape species. The hyaena is the
  spotted kind. The hunting dog is present. There are some seven species of
  monkeys, including two baboons and one colobus. The hippopotamus is found
  in the lakes and rivers, and all these sheets of water are infested with
  crocodiles, apparently belonging to but one species, the common Nile
  crocodile.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Inhabitants.</i>—The human race is represented by only one
  indigenous native type—the Negro. No trace is anywhere found of a
  Hamitic intermixture (unless perhaps at the north end of Lake Nyasa,
  where the physique of the native Awankonde recalls that of the Nilotic
  negro). Arabs from Zanzibar have settled in the country, but not, as far
  as is known, earlier than the beginning of the 19th century. As the
  present writer takes the general term "Negro" to include equally the
  Bantu, Hottentot, Bushman and Congo Pygmy, this designation will cover
  all the natives of British Central Africa. The Bantu races, however,
  exhibit in some parts signs of Hottentot or Bushman intermixture, and
  there are legends in some mountain districts, especially Mount Mlanje, of
  the former existence of unmixed Bushman tribes, while Bushman stone
  implements are found at the south end of Tanganyika. At the present day
  the population is, as a rule, of a black or chocolate-coloured Negro
  type, and belongs, linguistically, entirely and exclusively to the Bantu
  family. The languages spoken offer several very interesting forms of
  Bantu speech, notably in the districts between the north end of Lake
  Nyasa, the south end of Lake Tanganyika, and the river Luapula. In the
  more or less plateau country included within these geographical limits,
  the Bantu dialects are of an archaic type, and to the present writer it
  has seemed as though one of them, Kibemba or Kiwemba, came near to the
  original form of the Bantu mother-language, though not nearer than the
  interesting Subiya of southern Barotseland. Through dialects spoken on
  the west and north of Tanganyika, these languages of North Eastern
  Rhodesia and northern Nyasaland and of the Kafukwe basin are connected
  with the Bantu languages of Uganda. They also offer a slight resemblance
  to Zulu-Kaffir, and it would seem as though the Zulu-Kaffir race must
  have come straight down from the countries to the north-east of
  Tanganyika, across the Zambezi, to their present home. Curiously enough,
  some hundreds of years after this southward migration, intestine wars and
  conflicts actually determined a north-eastward return migration of Zulus.
  From Matabeleland, Zulu tribes crossed the Zambezi at various periods
  (commencing from about 1820), and gradually extended their ravages and
  dominion over the plateaus to the west, north and north-east of Lake
  Nyasa. The Zulu language is still spoken by the dominating caste in West
  <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page597">[v.04
  p.0597]</ph>Nyasaland (see further <ph outputclass="sc">Zululand</ph>:
  <i>Ethnology</i>; <ph outputclass="sc">Rhodesia</ph>: <i>Ethnology</i>; and
  <ph outputclass="sc">Yaos</ph>). As regards foreign settlers in this part
  of Africa, the Arabs may be mentioned first, though they are now met with
  only in very small numbers. The Arabs undoubtedly first <i>heard</i> of
  this rich country—rich not alone in natural products such as ivory,
  but also in slaves of good quality—from their settlements near the
  delta of the river Zambezi, and these settlements may date back to an
  early period, and might be coeval with the suggested pre-Islamite Arab
  settlements in the gold-bearing regions of South East Africa. But the
  Arabs do not seem to have made much progress in their penetration of the
  country in the days before firearms; and when firearms came into use they
  were for a long time forestalled by the Portuguese, who ousted them from
  the Zambezi. But about the beginning of the 19th century the increasing
  power and commercial enterprise of the Arab sultanate of Zanzibar caused
  the Arabs of Maskat and Zanzibar to march inland from the east coast.
  They gradually founded strong slave-trading settlements on the east and
  west coasts of Lake Nyasa, and thence westwards to Tanganyika and the
  Luapula. They never came in great numbers, however, and, except here and
  there on the coast of Lake Nyasa, have left no mixed descendants in the
  population. The total native population of all British Central Africa is
  about 2,000,000, that of the Nyasaland Protectorate being officially
  estimated in 1907 at 927,355. Of Europeans the protectorate possesses
  about 600 to 700 settlers, including some 100 officials. (For the
  European population of the other territories, see <ph outputclass="sc">Rhodesia</ph>.) The Europeans of British Central Africa are
  chiefly natives of the United Kingdom or South Africa, but there are a
  few Germans, Dutchmen, French, Italians and Portuguese. The protectorate
  has also attracted a number of Indian traders (over 400), besides whom
  about 150 British Indian soldiers (Sikhs) are employed as the nucleus of
  an armed force.<xref href="#d1e14828/Footnote_102" type="fn"><!--[2]--></xref>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>Trade and Communications.</i>—The total value of the trade of
  the protectorate in the year 1899-1900 was £255,384, showing an increase
  of 75% on the figures for the previous year, 1898-1899. Imports were
  valued at £176,035, an increase of 62%, and exports at £79,449, an
  increase of 109%. In 1905-1906 the imports reached £222,581 and the
  exports £56,778. The value of imports into the Rhodesian provinces during
  the same period was about £50,000, excluding railway material, and the
  exports £18,000. The principal exports are (besides minerals) coffee,
  cotton, tobacco, rubber and ivory. A number of Englishmen and Scotsmen
  (perhaps 200) are settled, mainly in the Shiré Highlands, as coffee
  planters.</p>
      <p>From the Chinde mouth of the Zambezi to Port Herald on the lower Shiré
  communication is maintained by light-draught steamers, though in the dry
  season (April-November) steamers cannot always ascend as far as Port
  Herald, and barges have to be used to complete the voyage. A railway runs
  from Port Herald to Blantyre, the commercial capital of the Shiré
  Highlands. The "Cape to Cairo" railway, which crossed the Zambezi in 1905
  and the Kafukwe in 1906, reached the Broken Hill mine in 1907, and in
  1909 was continued to the frontier of Belgian Congo. There are regular
  services by steamer between the ports on Lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika. The
  African trans-continental telegraph line (founded by Cecil Rhodes) runs
  through the protectorate, and a branch line has been established from
  Lake Nyasa to Fort Jameson, the present headquarters of the Chartered
  Company in North Eastern Rhodesia.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Towns.</i>—The principal European settlement or town is
  Blantyre (<i>q.v.</i>), at a height of about 3000 ft. above the sea, in
  the Shiré Highlands. This place was named after Livingstone's birthplace,
  and was founded in 1876 by the Church of Scotland mission. The government
  capital of the protectorate, however, is Zomba, at the base of the
  mountain of that name. Other townships or sites of European settlements
  are Port Herald (on the lower Shiré), Chiromo (at the junction of the Ruo
  and the Shiré), Fort Anderson (on Mount Mlanje), Fort Johnston (near the
  outlet of the river Shiré from the south end of Lake Nyasa), Kotakota and
  Bandawe (on the west coast of Lake Nyasa), Likoma (on an island off the
  east coast of Lake Nyasa), Karonga (on the north-west coast of Lake
  Nyasa), Fife (on the Nyasa-Tanganyika plateau), Fort Jameson (capital of
  N.E. Rhodesia, near the river Luangwa), Abercorn (on the south end of
  Lake Tanganyika), Kalungwisi (on the east coast of Lake Mweru) and Fort
  Rosebery (near the Johnston Falls on the Luapula [upper Congo]).</p>
      <p>
         <i>Administration.</i>—The present political divisions of the
  country are as follows:—The Nyasaland Protectorate, <i>i.e.</i> the
  districts surrounding Lake Nyasa and the Shiré province, are administered
  directly under the imperial government by a governor, who acts under the
  orders of the colonial office. The governor is assisted by an executive
  council and by a nominated legislative council, which consists of at
  least three members. The districts to the westward, forming the provinces
  of North Eastern and North Western Rhodesia, are governed by two
  administrators of the British South Africa Chartered Company, in
  consultation with the governor of Nyasaland and the colonial office.</p>
      <p>
         <i>History.</i>—The history of the territory dealt with above is
  recent and slight. Apart from the vague Portuguese wanderings during the
  16th and 17th centuries, the first European explorer of any education who
  penetrated into this country was the celebrated Portuguese official, Dr
  F.J.M. de Lacerda e Almeida, who journeyed from Tete on the Zambezi to
  the vicinity of Lake Mweru. But the real history of the country begins
  with the advent of David Livingstone, who in 1859 penetrated up the Shiré
  river and discovered Lake Nyasa. Livingstone's subsequent journeys, to
  the south end of Tanganyika, to Lake Mweru and to Lake Bangweulu (where
  he died in 1873), opened up this important part of South Central Africa
  and centred in it British interests in a very particular manner.
  Livingstone's death was soon followed by the entry of various missionary
  societies, who commenced the evangelization of the country; and these
  missionaries, together with a few Scottish settlers, steadily opposed the
  attempts of the Portuguese to extend their sway in this direction from
  the adjoining provinces of Moçambique and of the Zambezi. From out of the
  missionary societies grew a trading company, the African Lakes Trading
  Corporation. This body came into conflict with a number of Arabs who had
  established themselves on the north end of Lake Nyasa. About 1885 a
  struggle began between Arab and Briton for the possession of the country,
  which was not terminated until the year 1896. The African Lakes
  Corporation in its unofficial war enlisted volunteers, amongst whom were
  Captain (afterwards Sir F.D.) Lugard and Mr (afterwards Sir) Alfred
  Sharpe. Both these gentlemen were wounded, and the operations they
  undertook were not crowned with complete success. In 1889 Mr (afterwards
  Sir) H.H. Johnston was sent out to endeavour to effect a possible
  arrangement of the dispute between the Arabs and the African Lakes
  Corporation, and also to ensure the protection of friendly native chiefs
  from Portuguese aggression beyond a certain point. The outcome of these
  efforts and the treaties made was the creation of the British
  protectorate and sphere of influence north of the Zambezi (see <ph outputclass="sc">Africa</ph>; § 5). In 1891 Johnston returned to the country
  as imperial commissioner and consul-general. In the interval between 1889
  and 1891 Mr Alfred Sharpe, on behalf of Cecil Rhodes, had brought a large
  part of the country into treaty with the British South Africa Company,
  These territories (Northern Rhodesia) were administered for four years by
  Sir Harry Johnston in connexion with the British Central Africa
  protectorate. Between 1891 and 1895 a long struggle continued, between
  the British authorities on the one hand and the Arabs and Mahommedan Yaos
  on the other, regarding the suppression of the slave trade. By the
  beginning of 1896 the last Arab stronghold was taken and the Yaos were
  completely reduced to submission. Then followed, during 1896-1898, wars
  with the Zulu (Angoni) tribes, who claimed to dominate and harass the
  native populations to the west of Lake Nyasa. The Angoni having been
  subdued, and the British South Africa Company having also quelled the
  turbulent Awemba and Bashukulumbwe, there is a reasonable hope of the
  country enjoying a settled peace and considerable prosperity. This
  prospect has been, indeed, already realized to a considerable extent,
  though the increase of commerce has scarcely been as rapid as was
  anticipated. In 1897, on the transference of Sir Harry Johnston to Tunis,
  the commissionership was conferred on Mr Alfred Sharpe, who was created a
  K.C.M.G. in 1903. In 1904 the administration of the protectorate,
  originally directed by the foreign office, was transferred to the
  colonial office. In 1907, on the change in the title of the protectorate,
  the designation of the chief official was altered from commissioner to
  governor, and executive and legislative councils were established. The
  mineral <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page598">[v.04 p.0598]</ph>surveys and railway construction
  commenced under the foreign office were carried on vigorously under the
  colonial office. The increased revenue, from £51,000 in 1901-1902 to
  £76,000 in 1905-1906, for the protectorate alone (see also <ph outputclass="sc">Rhodesia</ph>), is an evidence of increasing prosperity.
  Expenditure in excess of revenue is met by grants in aid from the
  imperial exchequer, so far as the Nyasaland Protectorate is concerned.
  The British South Africa Company finances the remainder. The native
  population is well disposed towards European rule, having, indeed, at all
  times furnished the principal contingent of the armed force with which
  the African Lakes Company, British South Africa Company or the British
  government endeavoured to oppose Arab, Zulu or Awemba aggression. The
  protectorate government maintains three gunboats on Lake Nyasa, and the
  British South Africa Company an armed steamer on Lake Tanganyika.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, though so rich and fertile, the land is not as a rule
  very healthy for Europeans, though there are signs of improvement in this
  respect. The principal scourges are black-water fever and dysentery,
  besides ordinary malarial fever, malarial ulcers, pneumonia and
  bronchitis. The climate is agreeable, and except in the low-lying
  districts is never unbearably hot; while on the high mountain plateaus
  frost frequently occurs during the dry season.</p>
