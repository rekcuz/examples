   <title>BUCKERIDGE, JOHN</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCKERIDGE, JOHN--> (c. 1562-1631), English divine, was a son of
  William Buckeridge, and was educated at the Merchant Taylors school and
  at St John's College, Oxford. He became a fellow of his college, and
  acted as tutor to William Laud, whose opinions were perhaps shaped by
  him. Leaving Oxford, Buckeridge held several livings, and was highly
  esteemed by King James I., whose chaplain he became. In 1605 he was
  elected president of St John's College, a position which he vacated on
  being made bishop of Rochester in 1611. He was transferred to the
  bishopric of Ely in 1628, and died on the 23rd of May 1631. The bishop
  won some fame as a theologian and a controversialist. Among his intimate
  friends was Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, whose "Ninety-one Sermons" were
  published by Laud and Buckeridge in 1629.</p>
