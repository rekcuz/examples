      <p><!--BRUCE,--> the name of an old Scottish family of Norman descent,
  taken from Bruis between Cherbourg and Vallonges. Variations of the name
  are Braose, Breaux and Brus. The first Robert de Brus, a follower of
  William the Conqueror, was rewarded by the gift of many manors, chiefly
  in Yorkshire, of which Skelton was the principal. His son, the second
  Robert, received from David I., his comrade at the court of Henry I., a
  grant of the lordship of Annandale. The fourth Robert married Isabel,
  natural daughter of William the Lion, and their son, the fifth Robert,
  married Isabel, second daughter of David, earl of Huntingdon, niece of
  the same Scottish king. The most famous member of the family is the
  eighth Robert, "the Bruce," who became king of Scotland in 1306. (See
