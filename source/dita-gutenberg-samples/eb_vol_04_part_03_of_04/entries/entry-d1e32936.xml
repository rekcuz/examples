   <title>BUENAVENTURA</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUENAVENTURA,--> a Pacific port of Colombia, in the department of
  Cauca, about 210 m. W.S.W. of Bogotá. Pop. about 1200. The town is
  situated on a small island, called Cascajal, at the head of a broad
  estuary or bay projecting inland from the Bay of Chocó and 10 m. from its
  mouth. Its geographical position is lat. 3° 48′ N., long. 77°
  12′ W. The estuary is deep enough for vessels of 24 ft. draught and
  affords an excellent harbour. Buenaventura is a port of call for two
  lines of steamers (English <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page752">[v.04 p.0752]</ph>and German), and is the Colombian
  landing-place of the West Coast cable. The town is mean in appearance,
  and has a very unhealthy climate, oppressively hot and humid. It is the
  port for the upper basin of the Cauca, an elevated and fertile region,
  with two large commercial centres, Popayan and Cali. In 1907 a railway
  was under construction to the latter, and an extension to Bogotá was also
  projected.</p>
