      <p><!--BULDANA,--> a town and district of India, in Berar. The town had a
  population in 1901 of 4137. The district has an area of 3662 sq. m. The
  southern part forms a portion of Berar Balaghat or Berar—above the
  Ghats. Here the general contour of the country may be described as a
  succession of small plateaus decreasing in elevation to the extreme
  south. Towards the eastern side of the district the country assumes more
  the character of undulating high lands, favoured with soil of a good
  quality. A succession of plateaus descends from the highest ridges on the
  north to the south, where a series of small ghats march with the nizam's
  territory. The small fertile valleys between the plateaus are watered by
  streams during the greater portion of the year, while wells of
  particularly good and pure water are numerous. These valleys are
  favourite village sites. The north portion of the district occupies the
  rich valley of the Purna. The district is rich in agricultural produce;
  in a seasonable year a many-coloured sheet of cultivation, almost without
  a break, covers the valley of the Purna. In the Balaghat also the crops
  are very fine. Situated as the district is in the neighbourhood of the
  great cotton market of Khamgaon, and nearer to Bombay than the other
  Berar districts, markets for its agricultural produce on favourable terms
  are easily found. In 1901 the population was 423,616, showing a decrease
  of 12% in the decade due to the effects of famine. The district was
  reconstituted, and given an additional area of 853 sq. m. in 1905; the
  population on the enlarged area in 1901 was 613,756. The only manufacture
  is cotton cloth. Cotton, wheat and oil-seeds are largely exported. The
  Nagpur line of the Great Indian Peninsula railway runs through the north
  of the district. The most important place of trade is Malkapur—pop.
  (1901) 13,112—with several factories for ginning and pressing
  cotton.</p>
