   <title>BROOKLINE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROOKLINE-->, a township of Norfolk county, Massachusetts, U.S.A.,
  about 3 m. S.W. of Boston, lying immediately S. of the Back Bay district.
  Pop. (1890) 12,103; (1900) 19,935, of whom 6536 were foreign-born; (1910,
  census) 27,792. The area of the township in 1906 was 6.75 sq. m. It is
  served by the Boston &amp; Albany railway, and is connected with Boston
  by an electric line. Brookline is the wealthiest of the residential
  suburbs of Boston; and contains a number of beautiful estates and homes.
  Within its limits are the villages of Cottage Farm, Longwood, and
  Reservoir Station, or Chestnut Hillâ€”the Chestnut Hill reservoir is
  just beyond the township. Brookline has an excellent public library. At
  Clyde Park are the grounds and club-house of the Boston Country Club.
  Brookline has long been regarded as a model city suburb. It is connected
  with <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page647">[v.04
  p.0647]</ph>Boston Common by boulevards of the Metropolitan Park
  System. The first settlement was probably made about 1635, and it was
  called Muddy River until 1705, when it was created a township under the
  name of Brookline. Up to 1793 it belonged to Suffolk county, of which
  Boston is a part, and since that time it has belonged to Norfolk county;
  but Boston has in its growth almost surrounded it, and because of its
  great wealth there has been a long struggle for and against its merger in
  Boston. Frederick Law Olmsted, the famous landscape gardener, had his
  home in Brookline, where there are various examples of his work.</p>
