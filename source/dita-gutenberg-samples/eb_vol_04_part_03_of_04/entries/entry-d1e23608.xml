   <title>BROWN, SAMUEL MORISON</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROWN, SAMUEL MORISON--> (1817-1856), Scottish chemist, poet and
  essayist, born at Haddington on the 23rd of February 1817, was the fourth
  son of Samuel Brown, the founder of <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page662">[v.04 p.0662]</ph>itinerating
  libraries, and grandson of John Brown, author of the <i>Self-Interpreting
  Bible</i>. In 1832 he entered the university of Edinburgh, where, after
  studying in Berlin and St Petersburg, he graduated as M.D. in 1839. About
  1840 he was engaged in experiments by which he sought to prove that
  "carbon in certain states of combination is susceptible of conversion
  into silicon," and his failure to establish this proposition had much to
  do with his want of success as a candidate for the chair of chemistry at
  Edinburgh in 1843. He held the doctrine that the chemical elements are
  compounds of equal and similar atoms, and might therefore possibly be all
  derived from one generic atom. In 1850 he published a tragedy, <i>Galileo
  Galilei</i>, and two volumes of his <i>Lectures on the Atomic Theory and
  Essays Scientific and Literary</i> appeared in 1858, with a preface by
  his kinsman Dr John Brown, the author of <i>Horae Subsecivae</i>. He died
  at Edinburgh on the 20th of September 1856.</p>
