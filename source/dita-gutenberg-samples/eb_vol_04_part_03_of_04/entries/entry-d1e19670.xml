   <title>BROACH</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROACH--> (Fr. <i>broche</i>, a pointed instrument, Med. Lat.
  <i>brocca</i>, cf. the Latin adjective <i>brochus</i> or <i>broccus</i>,
  projecting, used of teeth), a word, of which the doublet "brooch"
  (<i>q.v.</i>) has a special meaning, for many forms of pointed
  instruments, such as a bodkin, a wooden needle used in tapestry-making, a
  spit for roasting meat, and a tool, also called a "rimer," used with a
  wrench for enlarging or smoothing holes (see <ph outputclass="sc">Tool</ph>). From the use of a similar instrument to tap
  casks, comes "to broach" or "tap" a cask. A particular use in
  architecture is that of "broach-spire," a term employed to designate a
  particular form of spire, found only in England, which takes its name
  from the stone roof of the lower portion. The stone spire being octagonal
  and the tower square on plan, there remained four angles to be covered
  over. This was done with a stone roof of slight pitch, compared with that
  of the spire, and it is the intersection of this roof with the octagonal
  faces of the spire which forms the broach.</p>
