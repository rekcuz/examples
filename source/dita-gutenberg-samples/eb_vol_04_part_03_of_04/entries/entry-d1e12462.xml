   <body>
      <p><!--BRILLAT-SAVARIN, ANTHELME--> (1755-1826), French gastronomist, was
  born at Belley, France, on the 1st of April 1755. In 1789 he was a
  deputy, in 1793 mayor of Belley. To escape proscription he fled from
  France to Switzerland, and went thence to the United States, where he
  played in the orchestra of a New York theatre. On the fall of Robespierre
  he returned to France, and in 1797 became a member of the court of
  cassation. He wrote various volumes on political economy and law, but his
  name is famous for his <i>Physiologie du go√ªt</i>, a compendium of the
  art of dining. Many editions of this work have been published.
  Brillat-Savarin died in Paris on the 2nd of February 1826.</p>
