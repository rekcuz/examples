   <title>BREUGHEL</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BREUGHEL--> (or <ph outputclass="sc">Brueghel</ph>), <b>PIETER,</b>
  Flemish painter, was the son of a peasant residing in the village of
  Breughel near Breda. After receiving instruction in painting from Koek,
  whose daughter he married, he spent some time in France and Italy, and
  then went to Antwerp, where he was elected into the Academy in 1551. He
  finally settled at Brussels and died there. The subjects of his pictures
  are chiefly humorous figures, like those of D. Teniers; and if he wants
  the delicate touch and silvery clearness of that master, he has abundant
  spirit and comic power. He is said to have died about the year 1570 at
  the age of sixty; other accounts give 1590 as the date of his death.</p>
      <p>His son <ph outputclass="sc">Pieter</ph>, the younger (1564-1637), known
  as "Hell" Breughel, was born in Brussels and died at Antwerp, where his
  "Christ bearing the Cross" is in the museum.</p>
      <p>Another son <ph outputclass="sc">Jan</ph> (<i>c.</i> 1569-1642), known
  as "Velvet" Breughel, was born at Brussels. He first applied himself to
  painting flowers and fruits, and afterwards acquired considerable
  reputation by his landscapes and sea-pieces. After residing long at
  Cologne he travelled into Italy, where his landscapes, adorned with small
  figures, were greatly admired. He left a large number of pictures,
  chiefly landscapes, which are executed with great skill. Rubens made use
  of Breughel's hand in the landscape part of several of his small
  picturesâ€”such as his "Vertumnus and Pomona," the "Satyr viewing the
  Sleeping Nymph," and the "Terrestrial Paradise."</p>
