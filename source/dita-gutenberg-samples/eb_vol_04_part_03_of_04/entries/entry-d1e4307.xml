   <title>BRIDGE-HEAD</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIDGE-HEAD--> (Fr. <i>tÃªte-du-pont</i>), in fortification, a work
  designed to cover the passage of a river by means of fortifications <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page532">[v.04
  p.0532]</ph>on one or both banks. As the process of moving an army over
  bridges is slow and complicated, it is usually necessary to secure it
  from hostile interruption, and the works constituting the bridge-head
  must therefore be sufficiently far advanced to keep the enemy's artillery
  out of range of the bridges. In addition, room is required for the troops
  to form up on the farther bank. In former days, with short-range weapons,
  a bridge-head was often little more than a screen for the bridge itself,
  but modern conditions have rendered necessary far greater extension of
  bridge defences.</p>
