      <p><!--BRICK--> (derived according to some etymologists from the Teutonic
  <i>bricke</i>, a disk or plate; but more authoritatively, through the
  French <i>brique</i>, originally a "broken piece," applied especially to
  bread, and so to clay, from the Teutonic <i>brikan</i>, to break), a kind
  of artificial stone generally made of burnt clay, and largely used as a
  building material.</p>
      <p>
         <i>History</i>.—The art of making bricks dates from very early
  times, and was practised by all the civilized nations of antiquity. The
  earliest burnt bricks known are those found on the sites of the ancient
  cities of Babylonia, and it seems probable that the method of making
  strong and durable bricks, by burning blocks of dried clay, was
  discovered in this corner of Asia. We know at least that well-burnt
  bricks were made by the Babylonians more than 6000 years ago, and that
  they were extensively used in the time of Sargon of Akkad (<i>c.</i> 3800
  <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph>). The site of the ancient city of Babylon
  is still marked by huge mounds of bricks, the ruins of its great walls,
  towers and palaces, although it has been the custom for centuries to
  carry away from these heaps the bricks required for the building of the
  modern towns in the surrounding country. The Babylonians and Assyrians
  attained to a high degree of proficiency in brickmaking, notably in the
  manufacture of bricks having a coating of coloured glaze or enamel, which
  they largely used for wall decoration. The Chinese claim great antiquity
  for their clay industries, but it is not improbable that the knowledge of
  brickmaking travelled eastwards from Babylonia across the whole of Asia.
  It is believed that the art of making glazed bricks, so highly developed
  afterwards by the Chinese, found its way across Asia from the west,
  through Persia and northern India, to China. The great wall of China was
  constructed partly of brick, both burnt and unburnt; but this was built
  at a comparatively late period (<i>c.</i> 210 <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph>), and there is nothing to show that the Chinese
  had any knowledge of burnt bricks when the art flourished in
  Babylonia.</p>
      <p>Brickmaking formed the chief occupation of the Israelites during their
  bondage in Egypt, but in this case the bricks were probably sun-dried
  only, and not burnt. These bricks were made of a mixture of clay and
  chopped straw or reeds, worked into a stiff paste with water. The clay
  was the river mud from the banks of the Nile, and as this had not
  sufficient cohesion in itself, the chopped straw (or reeds) was added as
  a binding material. The addition of such substances increases the
  plasticity of wet clay, especially if the mixture is allowed to stand for
  some days before use; so that the action of the chopped straw was
  twofold; a fact possibly known to the Egyptians. These sun-dried bricks,
  or "adobes," are still made, as of old, on the banks of the Nile by the
  following method:—A shallow pit or bed is prepared, into which are
  thrown the mud, chopped straw and water in suitable proportions, and the
  whole mass is tramped on until it is thoroughly mixed and of the proper
  consistence. This mixture is removed in lumps and shaped into bricks, in
  moulds or by hand, the bricks being simply sun-dried.</p>
      <p>Pliny mentions that three kinds of bricks were made by the Greeks, but
  there is no indication that they were used to any great extent, and
  probably the walls of Athens on the side towards Mount Hymettus were the
  most important brick-structures in ancient Greece. The Romans became
  masters of the brickmaker's art, though they probably acquired much of
  their knowledge in the East, during their occupation of Egypt and Greece.
  In any case they revived and extended the manufacture of bricks about the
  beginning of the Christian era; exercising great care in the selection
  and preparation of their clay, and introducing the method of burning
  bricks in kilns. They carried their knowledge and their methods
  throughout western Europe, and there is abundant evidence that they made
  bricks extensively in Germany and in Britain.</p>
      <p>Although brickmaking was thus introduced into Britain nearly 2000
  years ago, the art seems to have been lost when the Romans withdrew from
  the country, and it is doubtful whether any burnt bricks were made in
  England from that time until the 13th century. Such bricks as were used
  during this long <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page518">[v.04 p.0518]</ph>period were generally taken from
  the remains of Roman buildings, as at Colchester and St Albans Abbey. One
  of the earliest existing brick buildings, erected after the revival of
  brickmaking in England, is Little Wenham Hall, in Suffolk, built about
  <ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph> 1210; but it was not until the 15th
  century that bricks came into general use again, and then only for
  important edifices. During the reign of Henry VIII. brickmaking was
  brought to great perfection, probably by workmen brought from Flanders,
  and the older portions of St James's Palace and Hampton Court Palace
  remain to testify to the skill then attained. In the 16th century bricks
  were increasingly used, but down to the Great Fire of London, in 1666,
  the smaller buildings, shops and dwelling-houses, were constructed of
  timber framework filled in with lath and plaster. In the rebuilding of
  London after the fire, bricks were largely used, and from the end of the
  17th century to the present day they have been almost exclusively used in
  all ordinary buildings throughout the country, except in those districts
  where building stone is plentiful and good brick-clay is not readily
  procurable. The bricks made in England before 1625 were of many sizes,
  there being no recognized standard; but in that year the sizes were
  regulated by statute, and the present standard size was adopted, viz. 9 x
  4½ x 3 in. In 1784 a tax was levied on bricks, which was not repealed
  until 1850. The tax averaged about 4s. 7d. per thousand on ordinary
  bricks, and special bricks were still more heavily taxed.</p>
      <p>The first brick buildings in America were erected on Manhattan Island
  in the year 1633 by a governor of the Dutch West India Company. These
  bricks were made in Holland, where the industry had long reached great
  excellence; and for many years bricks were imported into America from
  Holland and from England. In America burnt bricks were first made at New
  Haven about 1650, and the manufacture slowly spread through the New
  England states; but for many years the home-made article was inferior to
  that imported from Europe.</p>
      <p>The Dutch and the Germans were the great brickmakers of Europe during
  the middle ages, although the Italians, from the 14th to the 15th
  century, revived and developed the art of decorative brick-work or
  terra-cotta, and discovered the method of applying coloured enamels to
  these materials. Under the Della Robbias, in the 15th century, some of
  the finest work of this class that the world has seen was executed, but
  it can scarcely be included under brickwork.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Brick Clays</i>.—All clays are the result of the denudation
  and decomposition of felspathic and siliceous rocks, and consist of the
  fine insoluble particles which have been carried in suspension in water
  and deposited in geologic basins according to their specific gravity and
  degree of fineness (see <ph outputclass="sc">Clay</ph>). These deposits
  have been formed in all geologic epochs from the "Recent" to the
  "Cambrian," and they vary in hardness from the soft and plastic
  "alluvial" clays to the hard and rock-like shales and slates of the older
  formations. The alluvial and drift clays (which were alone used for
  brickmaking until modern times) are found near the surface, are readily
  worked and require little preparation, whereas the older sedimentary
  deposits are often difficult to work and necessitate the use of heavy
  machinery. These older shales, or rocky clays, may be brought into
  plastic condition by long weathering (<i>i.e.</i> by exposure to rain,
  frost and sun) or by crushing and grinding in water, and they then
  resemble ordinary alluvial clays in every respect.</p>
      <p>The clays or earths from which burnt bricks are made may be divided
  into two principal types, according to chemical composition: (1) Clays or
  shales containing only a small percentage of carbonate of lime and
  consisting chiefly of hydrated aluminium silicates (the "true clay
  substance") with more or less sand, undecomposed grains of felspar, and
  oxide or carbonate of iron; these clays usually burn to a buff, salmon or
  red colour; (2) Clays containing a considerable percentage of carbonate
  of lime in addition to the substances above mentioned. These latter clay
  deposits are known as "marls,"<xref href="#d1e3101/Footnote_051" type="fn"><!--[1]--></xref> and may contain as much as 40% of
  chalk. They burn to a sulphur-yellow colour which is quite
  distinctive.</p>
      <p>Brick clays of class (1) are very widely distributed, and have a more
  extensive geological range than the marls, which are found in connexion
  with chalk or limestone formations only. These ordinary brick clays vary
  considerably in composition, and many clays, as they are found in nature,
  are unsuitable for brickmaking without the addition of some other kind of
  clay or sand. The strongest brick clays, <i>i.e.</i> those possessing the
  greatest plasticity and tensile strength, are usually those which contain
  the highest percentage of the hydrated aluminium silicates, although the
  exact relation of plasticity to chemical composition has not yet been
  determined. This statement cannot be applied indiscriminately to all
  clays, but may be taken as fairly applicable to clays of one general type
  (see <ph outputclass="sc">Clay</ph>). All clays contain more or less free
  silica in the form of sand, and usually a small percentage of
  undecomposed felspar. The most important ingredient, after the
  clay-substance and the sand, is oxide of iron; for the colour, and, to a
  less extent, the hardness and durability of the burnt bricks depend on
  its presence. The amount of oxide of iron in these clays varies from
  about 2 to 10%, and the colour of the bricks varies accordingly from
  light buff to chocolate; although the colour developed by a given
  percentage of oxide of iron is influenced by the other substances present
  and also by the method of firing. A clay containing from 5 to 8% of oxide
  of iron will, under ordinary conditions of firing, produce a red brick;
  but if the clay contains 3 to 4% of alkalis, or the brick is fired too
  hard, the colour will be darker and more purple. The actions of the
  alkalis and of increased temperature are probably closely related, for in
  either case the clay is brought nearer to its fusion point, and
  ferruginous clays generally become darker in colour as they approach to
  fusion. Alumina acts in the opposite direction, an excess of this
  compound tending to make the colour lighter and brighter. It is
  impossible to give a typical composition for such clays, as the
  percentages of the different constituents vary through such wide ranges.
  The clay substance may vary from 15 to 80%, the free silica or sand from
  5 to 80%, the oxide of iron from 1 to 10%, the carbonates of lime and
  magnesia together, from 1 to 5%, and the alkalis from 1 to 4%. Organic
  matter is always present, and other impurities which frequently occur are
  the sulphates of lime and magnesia, the chlorides and nitrates of soda
  and potash, and iron-pyrites. The presence of organic matter gives the
  wet clay a greater plasticity, probably because it forms a kind of
  mucilage which adds a certain viscosity and adhesiveness to the natural
  plasticity of the clay. In some of the coal-measure shales the amount of
  organic matter is very considerable, and may render the clay useless for
  brickmaking. The other impurities, all of which, except the pyrites, are
  soluble in water, are undesirable, as they give rise to "scum," which
  produces patchy colour and pitted faces on the bricks. The commonest
  soluble impurity is calcium sulphate, which produces a whitish scum on
  the face of the brick in drying, and as the scum becomes permanently
  fixed in burning, such bricks are of little use except for common work.
  This question of "scumming" is very important to the maker of high-class
  facing and moulded bricks, and where a clay containing calcium sulphate
  must be used, a certain percentage of barium carbonate is nowadays added
  to the wet clay. By this means the calcium sulphate is converted into
  calcium carbonate which is insoluble in water, so that it remains
  distributed throughout the mass of the brick instead of being deposited
  on the surface. The presence of magnesium salts is also very
  objectionable, as these generally remain in the burnt brick as magnesium
  sulphate, which gives rise to an efflorescence of fine white crystals
  after the bricks are built into position. Clays which are strong or
  plastic are known as "fat" clays, and they always contain a high
  percentage of true "clay substance," and, consequently, a low percentage
  of sand. Such clays take up a considerable amount of water in
  "tempering"; they dry slowly, shrink greatly, and so become liable to
  lose their shape and develop cracks in drying and firing. "Fat" clays are
  greatly improved by the addition of coarse sharp sand, <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page519">[v.04 p.0519]</ph>which
  reduces the time of drying and the shrinkage, and makes the brick more
  rigid during the firing. Coarse sand, unlike clay-substance, is
  practically unaffected during the drying and firing, and is a desirable
  if not a necessary ingredient of all brick clays. The best brick-clays
  feel gritty between the fingers; they should, of course, be free from
  pebbles, sufficiently plastic to be moulded into shape and strong enough
  when dry to be safely handled. All clays are greatly improved by being
  turned over and exposed to the weather, or by standing for some months in
  a wet condition. This "weathering" and "ageing" of clay is particularly
  important where bricks are made from tempered clay, <i>i.e.</i> clay in
  the wet or plastic state; where bricks are made from shale, in the
  semi-plastic condition, weathering is still of importance.</p>
      <p>The lime clays or "marls" of class (2), which contain essentially a
  high percentage of chalk or limestone, are not so widely distributed as
  the ordinary brick-clays, and in England the natural deposits of these
  clays have been largely exhausted. A very fine chalk-clay, or "malm" as
  it was locally called, was formerly obtained from the alluvium in the
  vicinity of London; but the available supply of this has been used up,
  and at the present time an artificial "malm" is prepared by mixing an
  ordinary brick-clay with ground chalk. For the best London facing-bricks
  the clay and chalk are mixed in water. The chalk is ground on
  grinding-pans, and the clay is mixed with water and worked about until
  the mixture has the consistence of cream. The mixture of these "pulps" is
  run through a grating or coarse sieve on to a drying-kiln or "bed," where
  it is allowed to stand until stiff enough to walk on. A layer of fine
  ashes is then spread over the clay, and the mass is turned over and mixed
  by spade, and tempered by the addition of water. In other districts,
  where clays containing limestone are used, the marl is mixed with water
  on a wash-pan and the resulting creamy fluid passed through coarse sieves
  on to a drying-bed. If necessary, coarse sand is added to the clay in the
  wash-pan, and such addition is often advisable because the washed clays
  are generally very fine in grain. Another method of treating these marls,
  when they are in the plastic condition, is to squeeze them by machinery
  through iron gratings, which arrest and remove the pebbles. In other
  cases the marl is passed through a grinding-mill having a solid bottom
  and heavy iron rollers, by which means the limestone pebbles are crushed
  sufficiently and mixed through the whole mass. The removal of limestone
  pebbles from the clay is of great importance, as during the firing they
  would be converted into quicklime, which has a tendency to shatter the
  brick on exposure to the weather. As before stated, these marls (which
  usually contain from 15 to 30% of calcium carbonate) burn to a yellow
  colour which is quite distinctive, although in some cases, where the
  percentage of limestone is very high, over 40%, the colour is grey or a
  very pale buff. The action of lime in bleaching the ferric oxide and
  producing a yellow instead of a red brick, has not been thoroughly
  investigated, but it seems probable that some compound is produced,
  between the lime and the oxide of iron, or between these two oxides and
  the free silica, entirely different from that produced by oxide of iron
  in the absence of lime. Such marls require a harder fire than the
  ordinary brick-clays in order to bring about the reaction between the
  lime and the other ingredients. Magnesia may replace lime to some extent
  in such marls, but the firing temperature must be higher when magnesia is
  present. Marls usually contract very little, if at all, in the burning,
  and generally produce a strong, square brick of fine texture and good
  colour. When under-fired, marl bricks are very liable to disintegrate
  under the action of the weather, and great care must be exercised in
  burning them at a sufficiently high temperature.</p>

         <i>Brickmaking</i>.—Bricks made of tempered clay may be made by
  hand or by machine, and the machines may be worked by hand or by
  mechanical power. Bricks made of semi-plastic clay (<i>i.e.</i> ground
  clay or shale sufficiently damp to adhere under pressure) are generally
  machine-made throughout. The method of making bricks by hand is the same,
  with slight variation, the world over. The tempered clay is pressed by
  hand into a wooden or metal mould or four-sided case (without top or
  bottom) which is of the desired shape and size, allowance being made for
  the shrinkage of the brick in drying and firing. The moulder stands at
  the bench or table, dips the mould in water, or water and then sand, to
  prevent the clay from sticking, takes a rudely shaped piece of clay from
  an assistant, and dashes this into the mould which rests on the moulding
  bench. He then presses the clay into the corners of the mould with his
  fingers, scrapes off any surplus clay and levels the top by means of a
  strip of wood called a "strike," and then turns the brick out of the
  mould on to a board, to be carried away by another assistant to the
  drying-ground. The mould may be placed on a special piece of wood, called
  the stock-board, provided with an elevated tongue of wood in the centre,
  which produces the hollow or "frog" in the bottom of the brick.</p>
      <p>Machine-made bricks may be divided into two kinds, plastic and
  semi-plastic, although the same type of machine is often used for both
  kinds.</p>
      <p>The machine-made plastic bricks are made of tempered clay, but
  generally the tempering and working of the clay are effected by the use
  of machinery, especially when the harder clays and shales are used. The
  machines used in the preparation of such clays are grinding-mills and
  pug-mills. The grinding-mills are either a series of rollers with
  graduated spaces between, through which the clay or shale is passed, or
  are of the ordinary "mortar pan" type, having a solid or perforated iron
  bottom on which the clay or shale is crushed by heavy rollers. Shales are
  sometimes passed through a grinding-mill before they are exposed to the
  action of the weather, as the disintegration of the hard lumps of shale
  greatly accelerates the "weathering." In the case of ordinary brick-clay,
  in the plastic condition, grinding-mills are only used when pebbles more
  than a quarter of an inch in diameter are present, as otherwise the clay
  may be passed directly through the pug-mill, a process which may be
  repeated if necessary. The pug-mill consists of a box or trough having a
  feed hole at one end and a delivery hole or nose at the other end, and
  provided with a central shaft which carries knives and cutters so
  arranged that when the shaft revolves they cut and knead the clay, and at
  the same time force it towards and through the delivery nose. The cross
  section of this nose of the pug-mill is approximately the same as that of
  the required brick (9 in. × 4½ in. plus contraction, for ordinary
  bricks), so that the pug delivers a solid or continuous mass of clay from
  which bricks may be made by merely making a series of square cuts at the
  proper distances apart. In practice, the clay is pushed from the pug
  along a smooth iron plate, which is provided with a wire cutting frame
  having a number of tightly stretched wires placed at certain distances
  apart, arranged so that they can be brought down upon, and through, the
  clay, and so many bricks cut off at intervals. The frame is sometimes in
  the form of a skeleton cylinder, the wires being arranged radially (or
  the wires may be replaced by metal disks); but in all cases bricks thus
  made are known as "wire-cuts." In order to obtain a better-shaped and
  more compact brick, these wire-cuts may be placed under a brick press and
  there squeezed into iron moulds under great pressure. These two processes
  are now generally performed by one machine, consisting of pug-mill and
  brick press combined. The pug delivers the clay, downwards, into the
  mould; the proper amount of clay is cut off; and the mould is made to
  travel into position under the ram of the press, which squeezes the clay
  into a solid mass.</p>
      <p>There are many forms of brick press, a few for hand power, but the
  most adapted for belt-driving; although in recent years hydraulic presses
  have come more and more into use, especially in Germany and America. The
  essential parts of a brick press are: (1) a box or frame in which the
  clay is moulded; (2) a plunger or die carried on the end of a ram, which
  gives the necessary pressure; (3) an arrangement for pushing the pressed
  brick out of the moulding box. Such presses are generally made of iron
  throughout, although other metals are used, occasionally, for the moulds
  and dies. The greatest variations found in brick presses are in the means
  adopted for actuating the ram; and many ingenious mechanical devices have
  been applied to this end, each claiming some particular advantage over
  its predecessors. In many recent presses, especially where semi-plastic
  clay is used, the brick is pressed simultaneously from top and bottom, a
  second ram, working upwards from beneath, giving the additional
  pressure.</p>
      <p>Although the best bricks are still pressed from tempered or plastic
  clay, there has recently been a great development in the manufacture of
  semi-plastic or dust-made bricks, especially in those districts where
  shales are used for brickmaking. These semi-plastic bricks are stamped
  out of ground shale that has been sufficiently moistened with water to
  enable it to bind together. The hard-clay, or shale, is crushed under
  heavy rollers in an iron grinding-pan having a perforated bottom through
  which the crushed clay passes, when sufficiently fine, into a small
  compartment underneath. This clay powder is then delivered, by an
  elevator, into a sieve or screen, which retains the coarser particles for
  regrinding. Sets of rollers may also be used for crushing shales that are
  only moderately hard, the ground material being sifted as before. The
  material, as fed <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page520">[v.04 p.0520]</ph>into the mould of the press, is a
  coarse, damp powder which becomes adhesive under pressure, producing a
  so-called "semi-plastic" brick. The presses used are similar to those
  employed for plastic clay, but they are generally more strongly and
  heavily built, and are capable of applying a greater pressure.</p>
      <p>The semi-plastic method has many advantages where shales are used,
  although the bricks are not as strong nor as perfect as the best
  "plastic" bricks. The method, however, enables the brickmaker to make use
  of certain kinds of clay-rock, or shale, that would be impracticable for
  plastic bricks; and the weathering, tempering and "ageing" may be largely
  or entirely dispensed with. The plant required is heavier and more
  costly, but the brickyard becomes more compact, and the processes are
  simpler than with the "plastic" method.</p>
      <p>The drying of bricks, which was formerly done in the open, is now, in
  most cases, conducted in a special shed heated by flues along which the
  heated gases from the kilns pass on their way to the chimney. It is
  important that the atmosphere of the drying-shed should be fairly dry, to
  which end suitable means of ventilation must be arranged (by fans or
  otherwise). If the atmosphere is too moist the surface of the brick
  remains damp for a considerable time, and the moisture from the interior
  passes to the surface as water, carrying with it the soluble salts, which
  are deposited on the surface as the water slowly evaporates. This deposit
  produces the "scum" already referred to. When the drying is done in a dry
  atmosphere the surface quickly dries and hardens, and the moisture from
  the interior passes to the surface as vapour, the soluble salts being
  left distributed through the whole mass, and consequently no "scum" is
  produced. Plastic bricks take much longer to dry than semi-plastic; they
  shrink more and have a greater tendency to warp or twist.</p>
      <p>The burning or firing of bricks is the most important factor in their
  production; for their strength and durability depend very largely on the
  character and degree of the firing to which they have been subjected. The
  action of the heat brings about certain chemical decompositions and
  re-combinations which entirely alter the physical character of the dry
  clay. It is important, therefore, that the firing should be carefully
  conducted and that it should be under proper control. For ordinary bricks
  the firing atmosphere should be oxidizing, and the finishing temperature
  should be adjusted to the nature of the clay, the object being to produce
  a hard strong brick, of good shape, that will not be too porous and will
  withstand the action of frost. The finishing temperature ranges from 900°
  C. to 1250° C., the usual temperature being about 1050° C. for ordinary
  bricks. As before mentioned, lime-clays require a higher firing
  temperature (usually about 1150° C. to 1200° C.) in order to bring the
  lime into chemical combination with the other substances present.</p>
      <p>It is evident that the best method of firing bricks is to place them
  in permanent kilns, but although such kilns were used by the Romans some
  2000 years ago, the older method of firing in "clamps" is still employed
  in the smaller brickfields, in every country where bricks are made. These
  clamps are formed by arranging the unfired bricks in a series of rows or
  walls, placed fairly closely together, so as to form a rectangular stack.
  A certain number of channels, or firemouths, are formed in the bottom of
  the clamp; and fine coal is spread in horizontal layers between the
  bricks during the building up of the stack. Fires are kindled in the
  fire-mouths, and the clamp is allowed to go on burning until the fuel is
  consumed throughout. The clamp is then allowed to cool, after which it is
  taken down, and the bricks sorted; those that are under-fired being built
  up again in the next clamp for refiring. Sometimes the clamp takes the
  form of a temporary kiln, the outside being built of burnt bricks which
  are plastered over with clay, and the fire-mouths being larger and more
  carefully formed. There are many other local modifications in the manner
  of building up the clamps, all with the object of producing a large
  percentage of well-fired bricks. Clamp-firing is slow, and also
  uneconomical, because irregular and not sufficiently under control; and
  it is now only employed where bricks are made on a small scale.</p>
      <p>Brick-kilns are of many forms, but they can all be grouped under two
  main types—Intermittent kilns and Continuous kilns. The
  intermittent kiln is usually circular in plan, being in the form of a
  vertical cylinder with a domed top. It consists of a single
  firing-chamber in which the unfired bricks are placed, and in the walls
  of which are contrived a number of fire-mouths where wood or coal is
  burned. In the older forms known as <i>up-draught</i> kilns, the products
  of combustion pass from the fire-mouth, through flues, into the bottom of
  the firing-chamber, and thence directly upwards and out at the top. The
  modern plan is to introduce the products of combustion near the top, or
  crown, of the kiln, and to draw them downwards through holes in the
  bottom which lead to flues connected with an independent chimney. These
  <i>down-draught</i> kilns have short chimneys or "bags" built round the
  inside wall in connexion with the fire-mouths, which conduct the flames
  to the upper part of the firing-chamber, where they are reverberated and
  passed down through the bricks in obedience to the pull of the chimney.
  The "bags" may be joined together, forming an inner circular wall
  entirely round the firing-chamber, except at the doorway; and a number of
  kilns may be built in a row or group having their bottom flues connected
  with the same tall chimney. Down-draught kilns usually give a more
  regular fire and a higher percentage of well-fired bricks; and they are
  more economical in fuel consumption than up-draught kilns, while the hot
  gases, as they pass from the kiln, may be utilized for drying purposes,
  being conducted through flues under the floor of the drying-shed, on
  their way to the chimney. The method of using one tall chimney to work a
  group of down-draught kilns naturally led to the invention of the
  "continuous" kiln, which is really made up of a number of separate kilns
  or firing-chambers, built in series and connected up to the main flue of
  the chimney in such a manner that the products of combustion from one
  kiln may be made to pass through a number of other kilns before entering
  the flue. The earliest form of continuous kiln was invented by Friedrich
  Hoffman, and all kilns of this type are built on the Hoffman principle,
  although there are a great number of modifications of the original
  Hoffman construction. The great principle of "continuous" firing is the
  utilization of the waste heat from one kiln or section of a kiln in
  heating up another kiln or section, direct firing being applied only to
  finish the burning. In practice a number of kilns or firing-chambers,
  usually rectangular in plan, are built side by side in two parallel
  lines, which are connected at the ends by other kilns so as to make a
  complete circuit. The original form of the complete series was elliptical
  in plan, but the tendency in recent years has been to flatten the sides
  of the ellipse and bring them together, thus giving two parallel rows
  joined at the ends by a chamber or passage at right angles. Coal or gas
  is burnt in the chamber or section that is being fired-up, the air
  necessary for the combustion being heated on its passage through the
  kilns that are cooling down, and the products of combustion, before
  entering the chimney flue, are drawn through a number of other kilns or
  chambers containing unfired bricks, which are thus gradually heated up by
  the otherwise waste-heat from the sections being fired. Continuous kilns
  produce a more evenly fired product than the intermittent kilns usually
  do, and, of course, at much less cost for fuel. Gas firing is now being
  extensively applied to continuous kilns, natural gas in some instances
  being used in the United States of America; and the methods of
  construction and of firing are carried out with greater care and
  intelligence, the prime objects being economy of fuel and perfect control
  of firing. Pyrometers are coming into use for the control of the firing
  temperature, with the result that a constant and trustworthy product is
  turned put. The introduction of machinery greatly helped the brickmaking
  industry in opening up new sources of supply of raw material in the
  shales and hardened clays of the sedimentary deposits of the older
  geologic formations, and, with the extended use of continuous firing
  plants, it has led to the establishment of large concerns where
  everything is co-ordinated for the production of enormous quantities of
  bricks at a minimum cost. In the United Kingdom, and still more in
  Germany and the United States of America, great improvements have been
  made in machinery, firing-plant and organization, so that the whole
  manufacture is now being conducted on more scientific lines, to the great
  advantage of the industry.</p>

         <i>Blue Brick</i> is a very strong vitreous brick of dark, slaty-blue
  colour, used in engineering works where great strength or impermeability
  is desirable. These bricks are made of clay containing front 7 to 10% of
  oxide of iron, and their manufacture is carried out in the ordinary way
  until the later stages of the firing process, when they are subjected to
  the strongly reducing action of a smoky atmosphere, which is produced by
  throwing small bituminous coal upon the fire-mouths and damping down the
  admission of air. The smoke thus produced reduces the red ferric oxide to
  blue-green ferrous oxide, or to metallic iron, which combines with the
  silica present to form a fusible ferrous silicate. This fusible "slag"
  partly combines with the other silicates present, and partly fills up the
  pores, and so produces a vitreous impermeable layer varying in thickness
  according to the duration and character of the smoking, the finishing
  temperature of the kiln and the texture of the brick. Particles of carbon
  penetrate the surface during the early stages of the smoking, and a small
  quantity of carbon probably enters into combination, tending to produce a
  harder surface and darker colour.</p>

         <i>Floating Bricks</i> were first mentioned by Strabo, the Greek
  geographer, and afterwards by Pliny as being made at Pitane in the Troad.
  The secret of their manufacture was lost for many centuries, but was
  rediscovered in 1791 by Fabroni, an Italian, who made them from the
  fossil meal (diatomaceous earth) found in Tuscany. These bricks are very
  light, fairly strong, and being poor conductors of heat, have been
  employed for the construction of powder-magazines on board ship,
  &amp;c.</p>

         <i>Mortar Bricks</i> belong to the class of unburnt bricks, and are,
  strictly speaking, blocks of artificial stone made in brick moulds. These
  bricks have been made for many years by moulding a mixture of sand and
  slaked lime and allowing the blocks thus made to harden in the air. This
  hardening is brought about partly by evaporation of the water, but
  chiefly by the conversion of the calcium hydrate, or slaked lime, into
  calcium carbonate by the action of the carbonic acid in the atmosphere. A
  small proportion of the lime enters into combination with the silica and
  water present to form hydrated calcium silicate, and probably a little
  hydrated basic carbonate of lime is also formed, both of which substances
  are in the nature of cement. This process of natural hardening by
  exposure to the air was a very long one, occupying from six to eighteen
  months, and many improvements were introduced during the latter half of
  the 19th century to improve the strength of the bricks and to hasten the
  hardening. <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page521">[v.04 p.0521]</ph>Mixtures of sand, lime and cement
  (and of certain ground blast-furnace slags and lime) were introduced; the
  moulding was done under hydraulic presses and the bricks afterwards
  treated with carbon dioxide under pressure, with or without the
  application of mild heat. Some of these mixtures and methods are still in
  use, but a new type of mortar brick has come into use during recent years
  which has practically superseded the old mortar brick.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Sand-lime Bricks</i>.—In the early 'eighties of the 19th
  century, Dr Michaelis of Berlin patented a new process for hardening
  blocks made of a mixture of sand and lime by treating them with
  high-pressure steam for a few hours, and the so-called <i>sand-lime</i>
  bricks are now made on a very extensive scale in many countries. There
  are many differences of detail in the manufacture, but the general method
  is in all cases the same. Dry sand is intimately mixed with about
  one-tenth of its weight of powdered slaked lime, the mixture is then
  slightly moistened with water and afterwards moulded into bricks under
  powerful presses, capable of exerting a pressure of about 60 tons per sq.
  in. After removal from the press the bricks are immediately placed in
  huge steel cylinders usually 60 to 80 ft. long and about 7 ft. in
  diameter, and are there subjected to the action of high-pressure steam
  (120 lb to 150 lb per sq. in.) for from ten to fifteen hours. The
  proportion of slaked lime to sand varies according to the nature of the
  lime and the purity and character of the sand, one of lime to ten of sand
  being a fair average. The following is an analysis of a typical German
  sand-lime brick: silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>), 84%; lime (CaO), 7%; alumina
  and oxide of iron, 2%; water, magnesia and alkalis, 7%. Under the action
  of the high-pressure steam the lime attacks the particles of sand, and a
  chemical compound of water, lime and silica is produced which forms a
  strong bond between the larger particles of sand. This bond of hydrated
  calcium silicate is evidently different from, and of better type than,
  the filling of calcium carbonate produced in the mortar-brick, and the
  sand-lime brick is consequently much stronger than the ordinary
  mortar-brick, however the latter may be made. The sand-lime brick is
  simple in manufacture, and with reasonable care is of constant quality.
  It is usually of a light-grey colour, but may be stained by the addition
  of suitable colouring oxides or pigments unaffected by lime and the
  conditions of manufacture.</p>
