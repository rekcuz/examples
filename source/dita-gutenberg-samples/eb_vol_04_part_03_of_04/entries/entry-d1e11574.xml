   <title>BRIDGMAN, LAURA DEWEY</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIDGMAN, LAURA DEWEY--> (1829-1889), American blind deaf-mute,
  was born on the 21st of December 1829 at Hanover, New Hampshire, U.S.A.,
  being the third daughter of Daniel Bridgman (d. 1868), a substantial
  Baptist farmer, and his wife Harmony, daughter of Cushman Downer, and
  grand-daughter of Joseph Downer, one of the five first settlers (1761) of
  Thetford, Vermont. Laura was a delicate infant, puny and rickety, and was
  subject to fits up to twenty months old, but otherwise seemed to have
  normal senses; at two years, however, she had a very bad attack of
  scarlet fever, which destroyed sight and hearing, blunted the sense of
  smell, and left her system a wreck. Though she gradually recovered health
  she remained a blind deaf-mute, but was kindly treated and was in
  particular made a sort of playmate by an eccentric bachelor friend of the
  Bridgmans, Mr Asa Tenney, who as soon as she could walk used to take her
  for rambles a-field. In 1837 Mr James Barrett, of Dartmouth College, saw
  her and mentioned her case to Dr Mussey, the head of the medical
  department, who wrote an account which attracted the attention of Dr S.G.
  Howe (<i>q.v.</i>), the head of the Perkins Institution for the Blind at
  Boston. He determined to try to get the child into the Institution and to
  attempt to educate her; her parents assented, and in October 1837 Laura
  entered the school. Though the loss of her eye-balls occasioned some
  deformity, she was otherwise a comely child and of a sensitive and
  affectionate nature; she had become familiar with the world about her,
  and was imitative in so far as she could follow the actions of others;
  but she was limited in her communication with others to the narrower uses
  of touchâ€”patting her head meant approval, rubbing her hand
  disapproval, pushing one way meant to go, drawing another to come. Her
  mother, preoccupied with house-work, had already ceased to be able to
  control her, and her father's authority was due to fear of superior
  force, not to reason. Dr Howe at once set himself to teach her the
  alphabet by touch. It is impossible, for reasons of space, to describe
  his efforts in detail. He taught words before the individual letters, and
  his first experiment consisting in pasting upon several common articles
  such as keys, spoons, knives, &amp;c., little paper labels with the names
  of the articles printed in raised letters, which he got her to feel and
  differentiate; then he gave her the same labels by themselves, which she
  learnt to associate with the articles they referred to, until, with the
  spoon or knife alone before her she could find the right label for each
  from a mixed heap. The next stage was to give her the component letters
  and teach her to combine them in the words she knew, and gradually in
  this way she learnt all the alphabet and the ten digits, &amp;c. The
  whole process depended, of course, on her having a human intelligence,
  which only required stimulation, and her own interest in learning became
  keener as she progressed. On the 24th of July 1839 she first wrote her
  own name legibly. Dr Howe devoted himself with the utmost patience and
  assiduity to her education and was rewarded by increasing success. On the
  20th of June 1840 she had her first arithmetic lesson, by the aid of a
  metallic case perforated with square holes, square types being used; and
  in nineteen days she could add a column of figures amounting to thirty.
  She was in good health and happy, and was treated by Dr Howe as his
  daughter. Her case already began to interest the public, and others were
  brought to Dr Howe for treatment. In 1841 Laura began to keep a journal,
  in which she recorded her own day's work and thoughts. In January 1842
  Charles Dickens visited the Institution, and afterwards wrote
  enthusiastically in <i>American Notes</i> of Dr Howe's success with
  Laura. In 1843 funds were obtained for devoting a special teacher to her,
  and first Miss Swift, then Miss Wight, and then Miss Paddock, were
  appointed; Laura by this time was learning geography and elementary
  astronomy. By degrees she was given religious instruction, but Dr Howe
  was intent upon not inculcating dogma before she had grasped the
  essential moral truths of Christianity and the story of the Bible. She
  grew up a gay, cheerful girl, loving, optimistic, but with a nervous
  system inclining to irritability, and requiring careful education in
  self-control. In 1860 her eldest sister Mary's death helped to bring on a
  religious crisis, and through the influence of some of her family she was
  received into the Baptist church; she became for some years after this
  more self-conscious and rather pietistic. In 1867 she began writing
  compositions which she called poems; the best-known is called "Holy
  Home." In 1872, Dr Howe having been enabled to build some separate
  cottages (each under a matron) for the blind girls, Laura was moved from
  the larger house of the Institution into one of them, and there she
  continued her quiet life. The death of Dr Howe in 1876 was a great grief
  to her; but before he died he had made arrangements by which she would be
  financially provided for in her home at the Institution for the rest of
  her life. In 1887 her jubilee was celebrated there, but in 1889 she was
  taken ill, and she died on the 24th of May. She was buried at Hanover.
  Her name has become familiar everywhere as an example of the education of
  a blind deaf-mute, leading to even greater results in Helen Keller.</p>
