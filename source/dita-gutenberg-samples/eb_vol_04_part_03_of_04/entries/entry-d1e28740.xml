   <title>BUCCARI</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCCARI--> (Serbo-Croatian <i>Bakar</i>), a royal free town of
  Croatia-Slavonia, Hungary; situated in the county of Modruš-Fiume,
  7 m. S.E. of Fiume, on a small bay of the Adriatic Sea. Pop. (1900) 1870.
  The Hungarian state railway from Zákány and Agram terminates 2½ m. from
  Buccari. The harbour, though sometimes dangerous to approach, affords
  good anchorage to small vessels. Owing to competition from Fiume, Buccari
  lost the greater part of its trade during the 19th century. The staple
  industry is boatbuilding, and there is an active coasting trade in fish,
  wine, wood and coal. The tunny-fishery is of some importance. In the
  neighbourhood of the town is the old castle of Buccarica, and farther
  south the flourishing little port of Porto Ré or Kraljevica.</p>
