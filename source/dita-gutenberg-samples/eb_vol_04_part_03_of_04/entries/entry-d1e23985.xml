   <title>BROWNE, PETER</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROWNE, PETER--> (?1665-1735), Irish divine and bishop of Cork and
  Ross, was born in Co. Dublin, not long after the Restoration. He entered
  Trinity College, Dublin, in 1682, and after ten years' residence obtained
  a fellowship. In 1699 he was made provost of the college, and in the same
  year published his <i>Letter in answer to a Book entitled "Christianity
  not Mysterious,"</i> which was recognized as the ablest reply yet written
  to Toland. It expounds in germ the whole of his later theory of analogy.
  In 1710 he was made bishop of Cork and Ross, which post he held till his
  death in 1733. In 1713 he had become somewhat notorious from his vigorous
  pamphleteering attack on the fashion of drinking healths, especially "to
  the glorious and immortal memory." His two most important works are the
  <i>Procedure, Extent, and, Limits of the Human Understanding</i> (1728),
  an able though sometimes captious critique of Locke's essay, and
  <i>Things Divine and Supernatural conceived by Analogy with Things
  Natural and Human</i>, more briefly referred to as the <i>Divine
  Analogy</i> (1733). The doctrine of analogy was intended as a reply to
  the deistical conclusions that had been drawn from Locke's theory of
  knowledge. Browne holds that not only God's essence, but his attributes
  are inexpressible by our ideas, and can only be conceived analogically.
  This view was vigorously assailed as leading to atheism by Berkeley in
  his <i>Alciphron</i> (Dialogue iv.), and a great part of the <i>Divine
  Analogy</i> is occupied with a defence against that criticism. The bishop
  emphasizes the distinction between metaphor and analogy; though the
  conceived attributes are not thought as they are in themselves, yet there
  is a reality corresponding in some way to our ideas of them. His
  analogical arguments resemble those found in the Bampton Lectures of Dean
  Mansel. Browne was a man of abstemious habits, charitable disposition,
  and impressive eloquence. He died on the 27th of August 1735.</p>
