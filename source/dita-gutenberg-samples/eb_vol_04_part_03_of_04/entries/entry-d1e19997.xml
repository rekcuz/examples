   <title>BROCKEN, SPECTRE OF THE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROCKEN, SPECTRE OF THE--> (so named from having been first
  observed in 1780 on the Brocken), an enormously magnified shadow of an
  observer cast upon a bank of cloud when the sun is low in high mountain
  regions, reproducing every motion of the observer in the form of a
  gigantic but misty image of himself.</p>
