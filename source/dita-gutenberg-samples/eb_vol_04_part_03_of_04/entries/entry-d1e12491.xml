   <title>BRIN, BENEDETTO</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIN, BENEDETTO--> (1833-1898), Italian naval administrator, was
  born at Turin on the 17th of May 1833, and until the age of forty worked
  with distinction as a naval engineer. In 1873 Admiral Saint-Bon, minister
  of marine, appointed him under-secretary of state. The two men completed
  each other; Saint-Bon conceived a type of ship, Brin made the plans and
  directed its construction. On the advent of the Left to power in 1876,
  Brin was appointed minister of marine by Depretis, a capacity in which he
  continued the programme of Saint-Bon, while enlarging and completing it
  in such way as to form the first organic scheme for the development of
  the Italian fleet. The huge warships "Italia" and "Dandolo" were his
  work, though he afterwards abandoned their type in favour of smaller and
  faster vessels of the "Varese" and the "Garibaldi" class. By his
  initiative Italian naval industry, almost non-existent in 1873, made
  rapid progress. During his eleven years' ministry (1876-1878 with
  Depretis, 1884-1891 with Depretis and Crispi, 1896-1898 with Rudini), he
  succeeded in creating large private shipyards, engine works and
  metallurgical works for the production of armour, steel plates and guns.
  In 1892 he entered the Giolitti cabinet as minister for foreign affairs,
  accompanying, in that capacity, the king and queen of Italy to Potsdam,
  but showed weakness towards France on the occasion of the massacre of
  Italian workmen at Aigues-Mortes. He died on the 24th of May 1898, while
  minister of marine in the Rudini cabinet. He, more than any other man,
  must be regarded as the practical creator of the Italian navy.</p>
