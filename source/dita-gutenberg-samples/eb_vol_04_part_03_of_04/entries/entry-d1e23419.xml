      <p><!--BROWN, JOHN--> (1722-1787), Scottish divine, was born at Carpow,
  in Perthshire. He was almost entirely self-educated, having acquired a
  knowledge of Latin, Greek and Hebrew while employed as a shepherd. His
  early career was varied, and he was in succession a packman, a soldier in
  the Edinburgh garrison in 1745, and a school-master. He was, from 1750
  till his death, minister of the Burgher branch of the Secession church
  (see <ph outputclass="sc">United Presbyterian Church</ph>) in Haddington.
  From 1786 he was professor of divinity for his denomination, and was
  mainly responsible for the training of its ministry. He gained a just
  reputation for learning and piety. The best of his many works are his
  <i>Self-Interpreting Bible</i> and <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>, works
  that were long very popular. The former was translated into Welsh. He
  also wrote an <i>Explication of the Westminster Confession</i>, and a
  number of biographical and historical sketches.</p>
