   <body>
      <p><!--BRILL,--> the name given to a flat-fish (<i>Psetta laevis</i>, or
  <i>Rhombus laevis</i>) which is a species closely related to the turbot,
  differing from it in having very small scales, being smaller in size,
  having no bony tubercules in the skin, and being reddish in colour. It
  abounds on parts of the British coast, and is only less favoured for the
  table than the turbot itself.</p>
