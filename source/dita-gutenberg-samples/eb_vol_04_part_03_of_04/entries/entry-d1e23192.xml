   <body>
      <p><!--BROUSSONET, PIERRE MARIE AUGUSTE--> (1761-1807), French
  naturalist, was born at Montpellier on the 28th of February 1761, and was
  educated for the medical profession. Visiting England, he was admitted in
  1872 an honorary member of the Royal Society, and in the same year
  published at London the first part of his work on fishes,
  <i>Ichthyologiae Decas I</i>, material for which was communicated to him
  by Sir Joseph Banks. On his return to Paris he was appointed perpetual
  secretary to the Society of Agriculture, and in 1789 became a member of
  the National Assembly. Under the convention he had to leave Paris, and
  after some dangers he made his way to Madrid. The enmity of the French
  emigrants, however, drove him from Spain, and afterwards from Lisbon, but
  at last he found a refuge in Morocco as physician to an embassy sent out
  by the United States. Later he obtained permission from the Directory to
  return to France, and in 1805 was appointed professor of botany at
  Montpellier, where he died on the 17th of January 1807.</p>
