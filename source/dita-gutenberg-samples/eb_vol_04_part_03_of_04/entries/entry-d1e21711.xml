   <title>BRONZITE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRONZITE,--> a member of the pyroxene group of minerals, belonging
  with enstatite and hypersthene to the orthorhombic series of the group.
  Rather than a distinct species, it is really a ferriferous variety of
  enstatite, which owing to partial alteration has acquired a bronze-like
  sub-metallic lustre on the cleavage surfaces. Enstatite is magnesium
  metasilicate, MgSiO<sub>3</sub>, with the magnesia partly replaced by
  small amounts (up to about 5%) of ferrous oxide; in the bronzite variety,
  (Mg,Fe)SiO<sub>3</sub>, the ferrous oxide ranges from about 5 to 14%, and
  with still more iron there is a passage to hypersthene. The ferriferous
  varieties are liable to a particular kind of alteration, known as
  "schillerization," which results in the separation of the iron as very
  fine films of oxide and hydroxides along the cleavage cracks of the
  mineral. The cleavage surfaces therefore exhibit a metallic sheen or
  "schiller," which is even more pronounced in hypersthene than in
  bronzite. The colour of bronzite is green or brown; its specific gravity
  is about 3.2-3.3, varying with the amount of iron present. Like
  enstatite, bronzite is a constituent of many basic igneous rocks, such as
  norites, gabbros, and especially peridotites, and of the serpentines
  which have been derived from them. It also occurs in some crystalline
  schists.</p>
      <p>Bronzite is sometimes cut and polished, usually in convex forms, for
  small ornamental objects, but its use for this purpose is less extensive
  than that of hypersthene. It often has a more or less distinct fibrous
  structure, and when this is pronounced the sheen has a certain
  resemblance to that of cat's-eye. Masses sufficiently large for cutting
  are found in the norite of the Kupferberg in the Fichtelgebirge, and in
  the serpentine of Kraubat near Leoben in Styria. In this connexion
  mention may be made of an altered form of enstatite or bronzite known as
  <i>bastite</i> or <i>schiller-spar</i>. Here, in addition to
  schillerization, the original enstatite has been altered by hydration and
  the product has approximately the composition of serpentine. In colour
  bastite is brown or green with the same metallic sheen as bronzite. The
  typical locality is Baste in the Radauthal, Harz, where patches of pale
  greyish-green bastite are embedded in a darker-coloured serpentine. This
  rock when cut and polished makes an effective decorative stone, although
  little used for that purpose.</p>
