   <title>BUGGY</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUGGY,--> a vehicle with either two (in England and India) or four
  wheels (in America). English buggies are generally hooded and for one
  horse. American buggies are for one horse or two, and either covered with
  a hood or open; among the varieties are the "Goddard" (the name of the
  inventor), the "box," so called from the shape of the body, the "cut
  under," i.e. cut out for the front wheels to cramp beneath and so turn in
  a narrow space, the "end-spring" and "side-bar," names referring to the
  style of hanging. A skeleton buggy, lightly constructed, is used on the
  American "speedways," built and maintained for fast driving. The word is
  of unknown origin; it may be connected with "bogie" (<i>q.v.</i>) a
  truck. The supposed Hindustani <i>baggÄ«</i>, a gig, often given as
  the source, appears to be an invention or an adaptation into the
  vernacular of the English word.</p>
