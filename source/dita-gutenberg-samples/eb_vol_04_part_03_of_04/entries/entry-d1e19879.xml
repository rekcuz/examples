   <title>BROCCHI, GIOVANNI BATTISTA</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROCCHI, GIOVANNI BATTISTA--> (1772-1826), Italian mineralogist
  and geologist, was born at Bassano on the 18th of February 1772. He
  studied at the university of Pisa, where his attention was turned to
  mineralogy and botany. In 1802 he was appointed professor of botany in
  the new lyceum of Brescia; but he more especially devoted himself to
  geological researches in the adjacent districts. The fruits of these
  labours appeared in different publications, particularly in his
  <i>Trattato mineralogico e chemico sulle miniere di ferro del
  dipartimento del Mella</i> (1808)â€”treatise on the iron mines of
  Mella. These researches procured him the office of inspector of mines in
  the recently established kingdom of Italy, and enabled him to extend his
  investigations over great part of the country. In 1811 he produced a
  valuable essay entitled <i>Memoria mineralogica sulla Valle di Fassa in
  Tirolo</i>; but his most important work is the <i>Conchiologia fossile
  subapennina con osservazioni geologiche sugli Apennini, e sul suolo
  adiacente</i> (2 vols., 4to, Milan, 1814), containing accurate details of
  the structure of the Apennine range, and an account of the fossils of the
  Italian Tertiary strata compared with existing species. These subjects
  were further illustrated by his geognostic map, and his <i>Catalogo
  ragionato di una raccolta di rocce, disposto con ordine geografico, per
  servire alla geognosia dell' Italia</i> (Milan, 1817). His work <i>Dello
  stato fisico del suolo di Roma</i> (1820), with its accompanying map, is
  likewise noteworthy. In it he corrected the erroneous views of Breislak,
  who conceived that Rome occupies the site of a volcano, to which he
  ascribed the volcanic materials that cover the seven hills. Brocchi
  pointed out that these materials were derived either from Mont Albano,
  <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page623">[v.04
  p.0623]</ph>an extinct volcano, 12 m. from the city, or from Mont
  Cimini, still farther to the north. Several papers by him, on
  mineralogical subjects, appeared in the <i>Biblioteca Italiana</i> from
  1816 to 1823. In the latter year Brocchi sailed for Egypt, in order to
  explore the geology of that country and report on its mineral resources.
  Every facility was granted by Mehemet Ali, who in 1823 appointed him one
  of a commission to examine the district of Sennaar; but Brocchi,
  unfortunately for science, fell a victim to the climate, and died at
  Khartum on the 25th of September 1826.</p>
