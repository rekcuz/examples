      <p><!--BUG,--> the name of two rivers of Europe. (1) A stream of European
  Russia, distinguished sometimes as the Southern Bug, which rises in the
  S. of the government of Volhynia, and flows generally S.E. through the
  governments of Podolia and Kherson, and after picking up the Ingul from
  the left at Nikolayev, enters the <i>liman</i> or lagoon into which the
  Dnieper also discharges. Its length is 470 m. Its upper part is beset
  with rapids, and its lower is of little value for navigation on account
  of the numerous sandbanks and blocks of rock which choke its bed. (2) A
  river distinguished as the Western Don, which rises in the E. of Austrian
  Galicia between Tarnopol and Brody, and flows N.N.W. as far as
  Brest-Litovsk, separating the Polish provinces of Lublin and Siedlce from
  the Russian governments of Volhynia and Grodno; it then swings away
  almost due W., between the provinces of Warsaw and Lomza, and joins the
  Vistula, 23 m. below the city of Warsaw. Length, 470 m. It is navigable
  from Brest-Litovsk downwards.</p>
