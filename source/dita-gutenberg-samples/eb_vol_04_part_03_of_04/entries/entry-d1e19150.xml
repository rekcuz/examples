   <title>BRITISH HONDURAS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRITISH HONDURAS-->, formerly called <ph outputclass="sc">Balize</ph>, or <ph outputclass="sc">Belize</ph>, a British
  crown colony in Central America; bounded on the N. and N.W. by the
  Mexican province of Yucatan, N.E. and E. by the Bay of Honduras, an inlet
  of the Caribbean Sea, and S. and W. by Guatemala. (For map, see <ph outputclass="sc">Central America</ph>.) Pop. (1905) 40,372; area, 7562 sq. m.
  The frontier of British Honduras, as defined by the conventions of 1859
  and 1893 between Great Britain and Guatemala, begins at the mouth of the
  river Sarstoon or Sarstun, in the Bay of Honduras; ascends that river as
  far as the rapids of Gracias à Dios; and thence, turning to the right,
  runs in a straight line to Garbutt's Rapids, on the Belize river. From
  this point it proceeds due north to the Mexican frontier, where it
  follows the river Hondo to its mouth in Chetumal Bay.</p>
      <p>British Honduras differs little from the rest of the Yucatan
  peninsula. The approach to the coast is through the islets known as cays,
  and through coral reefs. It is both difficult and dangerous. For some
  miles inland the ground is low and swampy, thickly covered with mangroves
  and tropical jungle. Next succeeds a narrow belt of rich alluvial land,
  not exceeding a mile in width, beyond which, and parallel to the rivers,
  are vast tracts of sandy, arid land, called "pine ridges," from the red
  pines with which they are covered. Farther inland these give place,
  first, to the less elevated "broken ridges," and then to what are called
  "cahoon ridges," with a deep rich soil covered with myriads of palm
  trees. Next come broad savannas, studded with clumps of, trees, through
  which the streams descending from the mountains wind in every direction.
  The mountains themselves rise in a succession of ridges parallel to the
  coast. The first are the Manatee Hills, from 800 to 1000 ft. high; and
  beyond these are the Cockscomb Mountains, which are about 4000 ft. high.
  No less than sixteen streams, large enough to be called rivers, descend
  from these mountains to the sea, between the Hondo and Sarstoon. The
  uninhabited country between Garbutt's Rapids and the coast south of Deep
  river was first explored in 1879, by Henry Fowler, the colonial secretary
  of British Honduras; it was then found to consist of open and undulating
  grasslands, affording fine pasturage in the west and of forests full of
  valuable timber in the east. Its elevation varies from 1200 to 3300 ft.
  Auriferous quartz and traces of other minerals have been discovered, but
  not in sufficient quantity to repay the cost of mining. The geology,
  fauna and flora of British Honduras do not materially differ from those
  of the neighbouring regions (see <ph outputclass="sc">Central
  America</ph>).</p>
      <p>Although the colony is in the tropics, its climate is subtropical. The
  highest shade temperature recorded is 98° F., the lowest 50°. Easterly
  sea-winds prevail during the greater part of the year. The dry season
  lasts from the middle of February to the middle of May; rain occurs at
  intervals during the other months, and almost continuously in October,
  November and December. The annual rainfall averages about 81½ in., but
  rises in some districts to 150 in. or more. Cholera, yellow fever and
  other tropical diseases occur sporadically, but, on the whole, the
  country is not unhealthy by comparison with the West Indies or Central
  American states.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Inhabitants.</i>—British Honduras is a little larger than
  Wales, and has a population smaller than that of Chester (England). In
  1904 the inhabitants of European descent numbered 1500, the Europeans
  253, and the white Americans 118. The majority belong to the hybrid race
  descended from negro slaves, aboriginal Indians and white settlers. At
  least six distinct racial groups can be traced. These consist of (1)
  native Indians, to be found chiefly in forest villages in the west and
  north of the colony away from the sea coast; (2) descendants of the
  English buccaneers, mixed with Scottish and German traders; (3) the
  woodcutting class known as "Belize Creoles," of more or less pure descent
  from African negroes imported, as slaves or as labourers, from the West
  Indies; (4) the Caribs of the southern districts, descendants of the
  population deported in 1796 from St Vincent, who were of mixed African
  and Carib origin; (5) a mixed population in the south, of Spanish-Indian
  origin, from Guatemala and Honduras; and (6) in the north another
  Spanish-Indian group which came from Yucatan in 1848. The population
  tends slowly to increase; about 45% of the births are illegitimate, and
  males are more numerous than females. Many tracts of fallow land and
  forest were once thickly populated, for British Honduras has its ruined
  cities, and other traces of a lost Indian civilization, in common with
  the rest of Central America.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Natural Products.</i>—-For more than two centuries British
  Honduras has been supported by its trade in timber, especially in
  mahogany, logwood, cedar and other dye-woods and cabinet-woods, such as
  lignum-vitae, fustic, bullet-wood, santa-maria, ironwood, rosewood,
  &amp;c. The coloured inhabitants are unsurpassed as woodmen, and averse
  from agriculture; so that there are only about 90 sq. m. of tilled land.
  Sugar-cane, bananas, cocoanut-palms, plantains, and various other fruits
  are cultivated; vanilla, sarsaparilla, sapodilla or chewing-gum, rubber,
  and the cahoon or coyol palm, valuable for its oil, grow wild in large
  quantities. In September 1903 all the pine trees on crown lands were sold
  to Mr B. Chipley, a citizen of the United States, at one cent (½ d.) per
  tree; the object of the sale being to secure the opening up of
  undeveloped territory. Unsuccessful attempts have been made to establish
  sponge fisheries on a large scale.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Chief Towns and Communications.</i>—Belize (pop. in 1904,
  9969), the capital and principal seaport, is described in a separate
  article. Other towns are Stann Creek (2459), Corosal (1696), Orange Walk
  (1244), Punta Gorda (706), the Cayo (421), Monkey River (384) and Mullins
  River (243). All these are administered by local boards, whose aggregate
  revenue amounts to some £7000. Telegraph and telephone lines connect the
  capital with Corosal in the north, and Punta Gorda in the south; but
  there are no railways, and few good roads beyond municipal limits. Thus
  the principal means of communication are the steamers which ply along the
  coast. Mail steamers from New Orleans, Liverpool, Colon and Puerto Cortes
  in Honduras, regularly visit Belize.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Commerce and Finance.</i>—Between 1901 and 1905 the tonnage
  of vessels accommodated at the ports of British Honduras rose from
  300,000 to 496,465; the imports rose from £252,500 to £386,123; the
  exports from £285,500 to £377,623. The exports consist of the timber,
  fruit and other vegetable products already mentioned, besides rum,
  deerskins, tortoiseshell, turtles and sponges, while the principal
  imports are cotton goods, hardware, beer, wine, spirits, groceries and
  specie. The sea-borne trade is mainly shared by Great Britain and the
  United States. On the 14th of October 1894, the American gold dollar was
  adopted as the standard coin, in place of the Guatemalan dollar; and the
  silver of North, South and Central America ceased to be legal tender.
  Government notes are issued to the value of 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 and 100
  dollars, and there is a local currency of one cent bronze pieces, and of
  5, 10, 25 and 50 cent silver pieces. The British sovereign and half
  sovereign are legal tender. In 1846 the government savings bank was
  founded in Belize; branches were afterwards opened in the principal
  towns; and in 1903 the British Bank of Honduras was established at
  Belize. The revenue, chiefly derived from customs, rose from £60,150 in
  1901 to £68,335 in 1905. The expenditure, in which the cost of police
  <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page616">[v.04
  p.0616]</ph>and education are important items, rose, during the same
  period, from £51,210 to £61,800. The public debt, amounting in 1905 to
  £34,736, represents the balance due on three loans which were raised in
  1885, 1887, and 1891, for public works in Belize. The loans are repayable
  between 1916 and 1923.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Constitution and Administration.</i>—From 1638 to 1786 the
  colonists were completely independent, and elected their own magistrates,
  who performed all judicial and executive functions. The customs and
  precedents thus established were codified and published under the name of
  "Burnaby's Laws," after the visit of Admiral Sir W. Burnaby, in 1756, and
  were recognized as valid by the crown. In 1786 a superintendent was
  appointed by the home government, and although this office was vacant
  from 1790 to 1797, it was revived until 1862. An executive council was
  established in 1839, and a legislative assembly, of three nominated and
  eighteen elected members, in 1853. British Honduras was declared a colony
  in 1862, with a lieutenant governor, subject to the governor of Jamaica,
  as its chief magistrate. In 1870 the legislative assembly was abolished,
  and a legislative council substituted—the constitution of this body
  being fixed, in 1892, at three official and five unofficial members. In
  1884 the lieutenant governor was created governor and commander-in-chief,
  and rendered independent of Jamaica. He is assisted by an executive
  council of three official and three unofficial members. For
  administrative purposes the colony is divided into six
  districts—Belize, Corosal, Orange Walk, the Cayo, Stann Creek and
  Toledo. The capital of the last named is Punta Gorda; the other districts
  take the names of their chief towns. English common law is valid
  throughout British Honduras, subject to modification by local enactments,
  and to the operation of the <i>Consolidated Laws of British Honduras</i>.
  This collection of ordinances, customs, &amp;c., was officially revised
  and published between 1884 and 1888. Appeals may be carried before the
  privy council or the supreme court of Jamaica,</p>
      <p>
         <i>Religion and Education.</i>—The churches represented are
  Roman Catholic, Anglican, Wesleyan, Baptist and Presbyterian; but none of
  them receives assistance from public funds. The bishopric of British
  Honduras is part of the West Indian province of the Church of England.
  Almost all the schools, secondary as well as primary, are denominational.
  School fees are charged, and grants-in-aid are made to elementary
  schools. Most of these, since 1894, have been under the control of a
  board, on which the religious bodies managing the schools are
  represented.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Defence.</i>—The Belize volunteer light infantry corps,
  raised in 1897, consists of about 200 officers and men; a mounted
  section, numbering about 40, was created in 1904. For the whole colony,
  the police Dumber about 120. There is also a volunteer fire brigade of
  335 officers and men.</p>
      <p>
         <i>History.</i>—"His Majesty's Settlement in the Bay of
  Honduras," as the territory was formerly styled in official documents,
  owes, its origin, in 1638, to log-wood cutters who had formerly been
  buccaneers. These were afterwards joined by agents of the Chartered
  Company which exploited the pearl fisheries of the Mosquito coast.
  Although thus industriously occupied, the settlers so far retained their
  old habits as to make frequent descents on the logwood establishments of
  the Spaniards, whose attempts to expel them were generally successfully
  resisted. The most formidable of these was made by the Spaniards in April
  1754, when, in consequence of the difficulty of approaching the position
  from the sea, an expedition, consisting of 1500 men, was organized inland
  at the town of Peten. As it neared the coast, it was met by 250 British,
  and completely routed. The log-wood cutters were not again disturbed for
  a number of years, and their position had become so well established
  that, in the treaty of 1763 with Spain, Great Britain, while agreeing to
  demolish "all fortifications which English subjects had erected in the
  Bay of Honduras," insisted on a clause in favour of the cutters of
  logwood, that "they or their Workmen were not to be disturbed or
  molested, under any pretext whatever, in their said places of cutting and
  loading logwood." Strengthened by the recognition of the crown, the
  British settlers made fresh encroachments on Spanish territory. The
  Spaniards, asserting that they were engaged in smuggling and other
  illicit practices, organized a large force, and on the 15th of September
  1779, suddenly attacked and destroyed the establishment at Belize, taking
  the inhabitants prisoners to Mérida in Yucatan, and afterwards to Havana,
  where most of them died, The survivors were liberated in 1782, and
  allowed to go to Jamaica. In 1783 they returned with many new
  adventurers, and were soon engaged in cutting woods. On the 3rd of
  September in that year a new treaty was signed between Great Britain and
  Spain, in which it was expressly agreed that his Britannic Majesty's
  subjects should have "the right of cutting, loading, and carrying away
  logwood in the district lying between the river Wallis or Belize and Rio
  Hondo, taking the course of these two rivers for unalterable boundaries."
  These concessions "were not to be considered as derogating from the
  rights of sovereignty of the king of Spain" over the district in
  question, where all the English dispersed in the Spanish territories were
  to concentrate themselves within eighteen months. This did not prove a
  satisfactory arrangement; for in 1786 a new treaty was concluded, in
  which the king of Spain made an additional grant of territory, embracing
  the area between the rivers Sibun or Jabon and Belize. But these extended
  limits were coupled with still more rigid restrictions. It is not to be
  supposed that a population composed of so lawless a set of men was
  remarkably exact in its observance of the treaty. They seem to have
  greatly annoyed their Spanish neighbours, who eagerly availed themselves
  of the breaking out of war between the two countries in 1796 to concert a
  formidable attack on Belize. They concentrated a force of 2000 men at
  Campeachy, which, under the command of General O'Neill, set sail in
  thirteen vessels for Belize, and arrived on the 10th of July, 1798. The
  settlers, aided by the British sloop of war "Merlin," had strongly
  fortified a small island in the harbour, called St George's Cay. They
  maintained a determined resistance against the Spanish forces, which were
  obliged to retire to Campeachy. This was the last attempt to dislodge the
  British.</p>
      <p>The defeat of the Spanish attempt of 1798 has been adduced as an act
  of conquest, thereby permanently establishing British sovereignty. But
  those who take this view overlook the important fact that, in 1814, by a
  new treaty with Spain, the provisions of the earlier treaty were revived.
  They forget also that for many years the British government never laid
  claim to any rights acquired in virtue of the successful defence; for so
  late as 1817-1819 the acts of parliament relating to Belize always refer
  to it as "a settlement, for certain purposes, under the protection of His
  Majesty." After Central America had attained its independence (1819-1822)
  Great Britain secured its position by incorporating the provisions of the
  treaty of 1786 in a new treaty with Mexico (1826), and in the drafts of
  treaties with New Granada (1825) and the United States of Central America
  (1831). The territories between the Belize and Sarstoon rivers were
  claimed by the British in 1836. The subsequent peaceful progress of the
  country under British rule; the exception of Belize from that provision
  of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty (<i>q.v.</i>) of 1850 which forbade Great
  Britain and the United States to fortify or colonize any point on the
  Central American mainland; and the settlement of the boundary disputes
  with Guatemala in 1859, finally confirmed the legal sovereignty of Great
  Britain over the whole colony, including the territories claimed in 1836.
  The Bay Islands were recognized as part of the republic of Honduras in
  1859. Between 1849, when the Indians beyond the Hondo rose against their
  Mexican rulers, and 1901, when they were finally subjugated, rebel bands
  occasionally attacked the northern and north-western marches of the
  colony. The last serious raid was foiled in 1872.</p>
