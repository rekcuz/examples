   <title>BUISSON, FERDINAND</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUISSON, FERDINAND--> (1841- ), French educationalist, was born at
  Paris on the 20th of December 1841. In 1868, when attached to the
  teaching staff of the Academy of Geneva, he obtained a philosophical
  fellowship. In 1870 he settled in Paris, and in the following year was
  nominated an inspector of primary education. His appointment was,
  however, strongly opposed by the bishop of Orleans (who saw danger to
  clerical influence over the schools), and the nomination was cancelled.
  But the bishop's action only served to draw attention to Buisson's
  abilities. He was appointed secretary of the statistical commission on
  primary education, and sent as a delegate to the Vienna exhibition of
  1873, and the Philadelphia exhibition of 1876. In 1878 he was instructed
  to report on the educational section of the Paris exhibition, and in the
  same year was appointed inspector-general of primary education. In 1879
  he was promoted to the directorship of primary education, a post which he
  occupied until 1896, when he became professor of education at the
  Sorbonne. At the general election of 1902 he was returned to the chamber
  of deputies as a radical socialist by the XIII<sup>me</sup>
  arrondissement of Paris. He supported the policy of M. Combes, and
  presided over the commission for the separation of church and state.</p>
