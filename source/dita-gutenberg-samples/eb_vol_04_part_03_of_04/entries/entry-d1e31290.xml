   <title>BUDDHA.</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUDDHA.--> According to the Buddhist theory (see <ph outputclass="sc">Buddhism</ph>), a "Buddha" appears from time to time in the
  world and preaches the true doctrine. After a certain lapse of time this
  teaching is corrupted and lost, and is not restored till a new Buddha
  appears. In Europe, Buddha is used to designate the last historical
  Buddha, whose family name was Gotama, and who was the son of
  Suddhōdana, one of the chiefs of the tribe of the Sākiyas,
  one of the republican clans then still existent in India.</p>
      <p>We are accustomed to find the legendary and the miraculous gathering,
  like a halo, around the early history of religious leaders, until the
  sober truth runs the risk of being altogether neglected for the
  glittering and edifying falsehood. The Buddha has not escaped the fate
  which has befallen the founders of other religions; and as late as the
  year 1854 Professor Wilson of Oxford read a paper before the Royal
  Asiatic Society of London in which he maintained that the supposed life
  of Buddha was a myth, and "Buddha himself merely an imaginary being." No
  one, however, would now support this view; and it is admitted that, under
  the mass of miraculous tales which have been handed down regarding him,
  there is a basis of truth already sufficiently clear to render possible
  an intelligent history.</p>
      <p>The circumstances under which the future Buddha was born were somewhat
  as follows.<xref href="#d1e31290/Footnote_291" type="fn"><!--[1]--></xref>
  In the 6th century <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph> the Āryan tribes
  had long been settled far down the valley of the Ganges. The old
  child-like joy in life so manifest in the Vedas had died away; the
  worship of nature had developed or degenerated into the worship of new
  and less pure divinities; and the Vedic songs themselves, whose freedom
  was little compatible with the spirit of the age, had faded into an
  obscurity which did not lessen their value to the priests. The country
  was politically split up into little principalities, most of them
  governed by some petty despot, whose interests were not often the same as
  those of the community. There were still, however, about a dozen free
  republics, most of them with aristocratic government, and it was in these
  that reforming movements met with most approval and support. A convenient
  belief in the doctrine of the transmigration of souls satisfied the
  unfortunate that their woes were the natural result of their own deeds in
  a former birth, and, though unavoidable now, might be escaped in a future
  state of existence by present good conduct. While hoping for a better
  fate in their next birth, the poor turned for succour and advice in this
  to the aid of astrology, witchcraft and animism—a belief in which
  seems to underlie all <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page738">[v.04 p.0738]</ph>religions, and still survives even
  in England.<xref href="#d1e31290/Footnote_292" type="fn"><!--[2]--></xref>
  The inspiriting wars against the enemies of the Āryan people, the
  infidel deniers of the Āryan gods, had given place to a succession
  of internecine feuds between the chiefs of neighbouring clans. In
  literature an age of poets had long since made way for an age of
  commentators and grammarians, who thought that the old poems must have
  been the work of gods. But the darkest period was succeeded by the dawn
  of a reformation; travelling logicians were willing to maintain these
  against all the world; whilst here and there ascetics strove to raise
  themselves above the gods, and hermits earnestly sought for some
  satisfactory solution of the mysteries of life. These were the teachers
  whom the people chiefly delighted to honour. Though the ranks of the
  priesthood were for ever firmly closed against intruders, a man of lay
  birth, a Kshatriya or Vaisya, whose mind revolted against the orthodox
  creed, and whose heart was stirred by mingled zeal and ambition, might
  find through these irregular orders an entrance to the career of a
  religious teacher and reformer.</p>
      <p>The Sākiya clan was then seated in a tract of country probably
  two or three thousand square miles in extent, the chief town of which was
  Kapilavastu, situate about 27° 37′ N. by 83° 11′ E., some
  days' journey north of Benares. Their territory stretched up into the
  lower slopes of the mountains, and was mostly in what is now Nepal, but
  it included territory now on the British side of the frontier. It is in
  this part of the Sākiya country that the interesting discovery was
  made of the monument they erected to their famous clansman. From their
  well-watered rice-fields, the main source of their wealth, they could see
  the giant Himālayas looming up against the clear blue of the Indian
  sky. Their supplies of water were drawn from the river Rohini, the modern
  Kohāna; and though the use of the river was in times of drought the
  cause of disputes between the Sākiyas and the neighbouring
  Koliyans, the two clans were then at peace; and two daughters of a
  chieftain of Koli, which was only 11 m. east of Kapilavastu, were the
  principal wives of Suddhōdana. Both were childless, and great was
  the rejoicing when, in about the forty-fifth year of her age, the elder
  sister, Mahā Māyā, promised her husband a son. In due
  time she started with the intention of being confined at her parents'
  home, but the party halting on the way under the shade of some lofty
  satin-trees, in a pleasant garden called Lumbini on the river-side, her
  son, the future Buddha, was there unexpectedly born. The exact site of
  this garden has been recently rediscovered, marked by an inscribed pillar
  put up by Asoka (see <i>J.R.A.S.</i>, 1898).</p>
      <p>He was in after years more generally known by his family name of
  Gotama, but his individual name was Siddhattha. When he was nineteen
  years old he was married to his cousin Yasodharā, daughter of a
  Koliyan chief, and gave himself up to a life of luxury. This is the
  solitary record of his youth; we hear nothing more till, in his
  twenty-ninth year, it is related that, driving to his pleasure-grounds
  one day, he was struck by the sight of a man utterly broken down by age,
  on another occasion by the sight of a man suffering from a loathsome
  disease, and some months after by the horrible sight of a decomposing
  corpse. Each time his charioteer, whose name was Channa, told him that
  such was the fate of all living beings. Soon after he saw an ascetic
  walking in a calm and dignified manner, and asking who that was, was told
  by his charioteer the character and aims of the Wanderers, the travelling
  teachers, who played so great a part in the intellectual life of the
  time. The different accounts of these visions vary so much as to cast
  great doubts on their accuracy; and the oldest one of all
  (<i>Anguttara</i>, i. 145) speaks of ideas only, not of actual visions.
  It is, however, clear from what follows, that about this time the mind of
  the young Räjput must, from some cause or other, have been deeply
  stirred. Many an earnest heart full of disappointment or enthusiasm has
  gone through a similar struggle, has learnt to look upon all earthly
  gains and hopes as worse than vanity, has envied the calm life of the
  cloister, troubled by none of these things, and has longed for an
  opportunity of entire self-surrender to abstinence and meditation.</p>
      <p>Subjectively, though not objectively, these visions may be supposed to
  have appeared to Gotama. After seeing the last of them, he is said, in
  the later accounts, to have spent the afternoon in his pleasure-grounds
  by the river-side; and having bathed, to have entered his chariot in
  order to return home. Just then a messenger arrived with the news that
  his wife Yasodhara had given birth to a son, his only child. "This," said
  Gotama quietly, "is a new and strong tie I shall have to break." But the
  people of Kapilavastu were greatly delighted at the birth of the young
  heir, the raja's only grandson. Gotama's return became an ovation;
  musicians preceded and followed his chariot, while shouts of joy and
  triumph fell on his ear. Among these sounds one especially attracted his
  attention. It was the voice of a young girl, his cousin, who sang a
  stanza, saying, "Happy the father, happy the mother, happy the wife of
  such a son and husband." In the word "happy" lay a double meaning; it
  meant also freed from the chains of rebirth, delivered, <i>saved</i>.
  Grateful to one who, at such a time, reminded him of his highest hopes,
  Gotama, to whom such things had no longer any value, took off his collar
  of pearls and sent it to her. She imagined that this was the beginning of
  a courtship, and began to build daydreams about becoming his principal
  wife, but he took no further notice of her and passed on. That evening
  the dancing-girls came to go through the Natch dances, then as now so
  common on festive occasions in many parts of India; but he paid them no
  attention, and gradually fell into an uneasy slumber. At midnight he
  awoke; the dancing-girls were lying in the ante-room; an overpowering
  loathing filled his soul. He arose instantly with a mind fully made
  up—"roused into activity," says the Sinhalese chronicle, "like a
  man who is told that his house is on fire." He called out to know who was
  on guard, and finding it was his charioteer Channa, he told him to saddle
  his horse. While Channa was gone Siddhattha gently opened the door of the
  room where Yasodhara was sleeping, surrounded by flowers, with one hand
  on the head of their child. He had hoped to take the babe in his arms for
  the last time before he went, but now he stood for a few moments
  irresolute on the threshold looking at them. At last the fear of
  awakening Yasodhara prevailed; he tore himself away, promising himself to
  return to them as soon as his mind had become clear, as soon as he had
  become a Buddha,—<i>i.e.</i> Enlightened,—and then he could
  return to them not only as husband and father, but as teacher and
  saviour. It is said to have been broad moonlight on the full moon of the
  month of July, when the young chief, with Channa as his sole companion,
  leaving his father's home, his wealth and social position, his wife and
  child behind him, went out into the wilderness to become a penniless and
  despised student, and a homeless wanderer. This is the circumstance which
  has given its name to a Sanskrit work, the Mahabhinishkramana Sutra, or
  Sutra of the Great Renunciation.</p>
      <p>Next is related an event in which we may again see a subjective
  experience given under the form of an objective reality. Mara, the great
  tempter, appears in the sky, and urges Gotama to stop, promising him, in
  seven days, a universal kingdom over the four great continents if he will
  but give up his enterprise.<xref href="#d1e31290/Footnote_293" type="fn"><!--[3]--></xref> When his words fail to have any
  effect, the tempter consoles himself by the confident hope that he will
  still overcome his enemy, saying, "Sooner or later some lustful or
  malicious or angry thought must arise in his mind; in that moment I shall
  be his master"; and from that hour, adds the legend, "as a shadow always
  follows the body, so he too from that day always followed the Blessed
  One, striving to throw every obstacle in his way towards the Buddhahood."
  Gotama rides a long distance that night, only stopping at the banks of
  the Anoma beyond the Koliyan territory. There, on the sandy bank of the
  river, at a spot where later piety erected a dagaba (a solid dome-shaped
  relic shrine), he cuts off with his sword his long flowing locks, and,
  taking off his ornaments, sends them and the horse back in charge of the
  unwilling Channa to Kapilavastu. The next seven days were spent alone in
  a grove of mango trees <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page739">[v.04 p.0739]</ph>near by, whence the recluse walks
  on to Rajagriha, the capital of Magadha, and residence of Bimbisara, one
  of the then most powerful rulers in the valley of the Ganges. He was
  favourably received by the raja; but though asked to do so, he would not
  as yet assume the responsibilities of a teacher. He attached himself
  first to a brahmin sophist named Alara, and afterwards to another named
  Udraka, from whom he learnt all that Indian philosophy had then to teach.
  Still unsatisfied, he next retired to the jungle of Uruvela, on the most
  northerly spur of the Vindhya range of mountains, and there for six
  years, attended by five faithful disciples, he gave himself up to the
  severest penance and self-torture, till his fame as an ascetic spread in
  all the country round about "like the sound," says the Burmese chronicle,
  "of a great bell hung in the canopy of the skies."<xref href="#d1e31290/Footnote_294" type="fn"><!--[4]--></xref> At last one day, when he was
  walking in a much enfeebled state, he felt on a sudden an extreme
  weakness, like that caused by dire starvation, and unable to stand any
  longer he fell to the ground. Some thought he was dead, but he recovered,
  and from that time took regular food and gave up his severe penance, so
  much so that his five disciples soon ceased to respect him, and leaving
  him went to Benares.</p>
      <p>There now ensued a second struggle in Gotama's mind, described with
  all the wealth of poetry and imagination of which the Indian mind is
  master. The crisis culminated on a day, each event of which is surrounded
  in the Buddhist accounts with the wildest legends, on which the very
  thoughts passing through the mind of Buddha appear in gorgeous
  descriptions as angels of darkness or of light. To us, now taught by the
  experiences of centuries how weak such exaggerations are compared with
  the effect of a plain unvarnished tale, these legends may appear childish
  or absurd, but they have a depth of meaning to those who strive to read
  between the lines of such rude and inarticulate attempts to describe the
  indescribable. That which (the previous and subsequent career of the
  teacher being borne in mind) seems to be possible and even probable,
  appears to be somewhat as follows.</p>
      <p>Disenchanted and dissatisfied, Gotama had given up all that most men
  value, to seek peace in secluded study and self-denial. Failing to attain
  his object by learning the wisdom of others, and living the simple life
  of a student, he had devoted himself to that intense meditation and
  penance which all philosophers then said would raise men above the gods.
  Still unsatisfied, longing always for a certainty that seemed ever just
  beyond his grasp, he had added vigil to vigil, and penance to penance,
  until at last, when to the wondering view of others he had become more
  than a saint, his bodily strength and his indomitable resolution and
  faith had together suddenly and completely broken down. Then, when the
  sympathy of others would have been most welcome, he found his friends
  falling away from him, and his disciples leaving him for other teachers.
  Soon after, if not on the very day when his followers had left him, he
  wandered out towards the banks of the Neranjara, receiving his morning
  meal from the hands of Sujata, the daughter of a neighbouring villager,
  and set himself down to eat it under the shade of a large tree (a
  <i>Ficus religiosa</i>), to be known from that time as the sacred Bo tree
  or tree of wisdom. There he remained through the long hours of that day
  debating with himself what next to do. All his old temptations came back
  upon him with renewed force. For years he had looked at all earthly good
  through the medium of a philosophy which taught him that it, without
  exception, contained within itself the seeds of bitterness, and was
  altogether worthless and impermanent; but now to his wavering faith the
  sweet delights of home and love, the charms of wealth and power, began to
  show themselves in a different light, and glow again with attractive
  colours. He doubted, and agonized in his doubt; but as the sun set, the
  religious side of his nature had won the victory, and seems to have come
  out even purified from the struggle. He had attained to Nirvana, had
  become clear in his mind, a Buddha, an Enlightened One. From that night
  he not only did not claim any merit on account of his self-mortification,
  but took every opportunity of declaring that from such penances no
  advantage at all would be derived. All that night he is said to have
  remained in deep meditation under the Bo tree; and the orthodox Buddhists
  believe that for seven times seven nights and days he continued fasting
  near the spot, when the archangel Brahmā came and ministered to
  him. As for himself, his heart was now fixed,—his mind was made
  up,—but he realized more than he had ever done before the power of
  temptation, and the difficulty, the almost impossibility, of
  understanding and holding to the truth. For others subject to the same
  temptations, but without that earnestness and insight which he felt
  himself to possess, faith might be quite impossible, and it would only be
  waste of time and trouble to try to show to them "the only path of
  peace." To one in his position this thought would be so very natural,
  that we need not hesitate to accept the fact of its occurrence as related
  in the oldest records. It is quite consistent with his whole career that
  it was love and pity for others—otherwise, as it seemed to him,
  helplessly doomed and lost—-which at last overcame every other
  consideration, and made Gotama resolve to announce his doctrine to the
  world.</p>
      <p>The teacher, now 35 years of age, intended to proclaim his new gospel
  first to his old teachers Ālāra and Udraka, but finding that
  they were dead, he determined to address himself to his former five
  disciples, and accordingly went to the Deer-forest near Benares where
  they were then living. An old <i>gāthhā</i>, or hymn
  (translated in <i>Vinaya Texts</i>, i. 90) tells us how the Buddha, rapt
  with the idea of his great mission, meets an acquaintance, one Upaka, a
  wandering sophist, on the way. The latter, struck with his expression,
  asks him whose religion it is that makes him so glad, and yet so calm.
  The reply is striking. "I am now on my way," says the Buddha, "to the
  city of Benares, to beat the drum of the Ambrosia (to set up the light of
  the doctrine of Nirvana) in the darkness of the world!" and he proclaims
  himself the Buddha who alone knows, and knows no teacher. Upaka says:
  "You profess yourself, then, friend, to be an Arahat and a conqueror?"
  The Buddha says: "Those indeed are conquerors who, as I have now, have
  conquered the intoxications (the mental intoxication arising from
  ignorance, sensuality or craving after future life). Evil dispositions
  have ceased in me; therefore is it that I am conqueror!" His acquaintance
  rejoins: "In that case, venerable Gotama, your way lies yonder!" and he
  himself, shaking his head, turns in the opposite direction.</p>
      <p>Nothing daunted, the new prophet walked on to Benares, and in the cool
  of the evening went on to the Deer-forest where the five ascetics were
  living. Seeing him coming, they resolved not to recognize as a superior
  one who had broken his vows; to address him by his name, and not as
  "master" or "teacher"; only, he being a Kshatriya, to offer him a seat.
  He understands their change of manner, calmly tells them not to mock him
  by calling him "the venerable Gotama"; that he has found the ambrosia of
  truth and can lead them to it. They object, naturally enough, from the
  ascetic point of view, that he had failed before while he was keeping his
  body under, and how can his mind have won the victory now, when he serves
  and yields to his body. Buddha replies by explaining to them the
  principles of his new gospel, in the form of noble truths, and the Noble
  Eightfold Path (see <ph outputclass="sc">Buddhism</ph>).</p>
      <p>It is nearly certain that Buddha had a commanding presence, and one of
  those deep, rich, thrilling voices which so many of the successful
  leaders of men have possessed. We know his deep earnestness, and his
  thorough conviction of the truth of his new gospel. When we further
  remember the relation which the five students mentioned above had long
  borne to him, and that they had passed through a similar culture, it is
  not difficult to understand that his persuasions were successful, and
  that his old disciples were the first to acknowledge him in his new
  character. The later books say that they were all converted at once; but,
  according to the most ancient Pāli record—though their old
  love and reverence had been so rekindled when the Buddha came near that
  their cold resolutions quite broke down, and they vied with each other in
  such acts of personal attention as an <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page740">[v.04 p.0740]</ph>Indian disciple
  loves to pay to his teacher,—yet it was only after the Buddha had
  for five days talked to them, sometimes separately, sometimes together,
  that they accepted in its entirety his plan of salvation.<xref href="#d1e31290/Footnote_295" type="fn"><!--[5]--></xref>
      </p>
      <p>The Buddha then remained at the Deer-forest near Benares until the
  number of his personal followers was about threescore, and that of the
  outside believers somewhat greater. The principal among the former was a
  rich young man named Yasa, who had first come to him at night out of fear
  of his relations, and afterwards shaved his head, put on the yellow robe,
  and succeeded in bringing many of his former friends and companions to
  the teacher, his mother and his wife being the first female disciples,
  and his father the first lay devotee. It should be noticed in passing
  that the idea of a priesthood with mystical powers is altogether
  repugnant to Buddhism; every one's salvation is entirely dependent on the
  modification or growth of his own inner nature, resulting from his own
  exertions. The life of a recluse is held to be the most conducive to that
  state of sweet serenity at which the most ardent disciples aim; but that
  of a layman, of a believing householder, is held in high honour; and a
  believer who does not as yet feel himself able or willing to cast off the
  ties of home or of business, may yet "enter the paths," and by a life of
  rectitude and kindness ensure for himself a rebirth under more favourable
  conditions for his growth in holiness.</p>
      <p>After the rainy season Gotama called together those of his disciples
  who had devoted themselves to the higher life, and said to them: "I am
  free from the five hindrances which, like an immense net, hold men and
  angels in their power; you too (owing to my teaching) are set free. Go ye
  now, brethren, and wander for the gain and welfare of the many, out of
  compassion for the world, to the benefit of gods and men. Preach the
  doctrine, beauteous in inception, beauteous in continuation, beauteous in
  its end. Proclaim the pure and perfect life. Let no two go together. I
  also go, brethren, to the General's village in the wilds of
  Uruvelā."<xref href="#d1e31290/Footnote_296" type="fn"><!--[6]--></xref> Throughout his career, Gotama
  yearly adopted the same plan, collecting his disciples round him in the
  rainy season, and after it was over travelling about as an itinerant
  preacher; but in subsequent years he was always accompanied by some of
  his most attached disciples.</p>
      <p>In the solitudes of Uruvelā there were at this time three
  brothers, fire-worshippers and hermit philosophers, who had gathered
  round them a number of scholars, and enjoyed a considerable reputation as
  teachers. Gotama settled among them, and after a time they became
  believers in his system,—the elder brother, Kassapa, taking
  henceforth a principal place among his followers. His first set sermon to
  his new disciples is called by Bishop Bigandet the Sermon on the Mount.
  Its subject was a jungle-fire which broke out on the opposite hillside.
  He warned his hearers against the fires of concupiscence, anger,
  ignorance, birth, death, decay and anxiety; and taking each of the senses
  in order he compared all human sensations to a burning flame which seems
  to be something it is not, which produces pleasure and pain, but passes
  rapidly away, and ends only in destruction.<xref href="#d1e31290/Footnote_297" type="fn"><!--[7]--></xref>
      </p>
      <p>Accompanied by his new disciples, the Buddha walked on to
  Rājagaha, the capital of King Bimbisāra, who, not unmindful
  of their former interview, came out to welcome him. Seeing Kassapa, who
  as the chronicle puts it, was as well known to them as the banner of the
  city, the people at first doubted who was the teacher and who the
  disciple, but Kassapa put an end to their hesitation by stating that he
  had now given up his belief in the efficacy of sacrifices either great or
  small; that Nirvāna was a state of rest to be attained only by a
  change of heart; and that he had become a disciple of the Buddha. Gotama
  then spoke to the king on the miseries of the world which arise from
  passion, and on the possibility of release by following the way of
  salvation. The rāja invited him and his disciples to eat their
  simple mid-day meal at his house on the following morning; and then
  presented the Buddha with a garden called Veluvana or Bamboo-grove,
  afterwards celebrated as the place where the Buddha spent many rainy
  seasons, and preached many of his most complete discourses. There he
  taught for some time, attracting large numbers of hearers, among whom
  two, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, who afterwards became
  conspicuous leaders in the new crusade, then joined the Sangha or
  Society, as the Buddha's order of mendicants was called.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the prophet's father, Suddhōdana, who had anxiously
  watched his son's career, heard that he had given up his asceticism, and
  had appeared as a Wanderer, an itinerant preacher and teacher. He sent
  therefore to him, urging him to come home, that he might see him once
  more before he died. The Buddha accordingly started for Kapilavastu, and
  stopped according to his custom in a grove outside the town. His father
  and uncles and others came to see him there, but the latter were angry,
  and would pay him no reverence. It was the custom to invite such teachers
  and their disciples for the next day's meal, but they all left without
  doing so. The next day, therefore, Gotama set out at the usual hour,
  carrying his bowl to beg for a meal. As he entered the city, he hesitated
  whether he should not go straight to his father's house, but determined
  to adhere to his custom. It soon reached his father's ears that his son
  was walking through the streets begging. Startled at such news he rose
  up, seizing the end of his outer robe, and hastened to the place where
  Gotama was, exclaiming, "Illustrious Buddha, why do you expose us all to
  such shame? Is it necessary to go from door to door begging your food? Do
  you imagine that I am not able to supply the wants of so many
  mendicants?" "My noble father," was the reply, "this is the custom of all
  our race." "How so?" said his father. "Are you not descended from an
  illustrious line? no single person of our race has ever acted so
  indecorously." "My noble father," said Gotama, "you and your family may
  claim the privileges of Kshatriya descent; my descent is from the
  prophets (Buddhas) of old, and they have always acted so; the customs of
  the law (Dharma) are good both for this world and the world that is to
  come. But, my father, when a man has found a treasure, it is his duty to
  offer the most precious of the jewels to his father first. Do not delay,
  let me share with you the treasure I have found." Suddhōdana,
  abashed, took his son's bowl and led him to his house.</p>
      <p>Eighteen months had now elapsed since the turning-point of Gotama's
  career—his great struggle under the Bo tree. Thus far all the
  accounts follow chronological order. From this time they simply narrate
  disconnected stories about the Buddha, or the persons with whom he was
  brought into contact,—the same story being usually found in more
  than one account, but not often in the same order. It is not as yet
  possible, except very partially, to arrange chronologically the snatches
  of biography to be gleaned from these stories. They are mostly told to
  show the occasion on which some memorable act of the Buddha took place,
  or some memorable saying was uttered, and are as exact as to place as
  they are indistinct as to time. It would be impossible within the limits
  of this article to give any large number of them, but space may be found
  for one or two.</p>
      <p>A merchant from Sūnaparanta having joined the Society was
  desirous of preaching to his relations, and is said to have asked
  Gotama's permission to do so. "The people of Sūnaparanta," said the
  teacher, "are exceedingly violent. If they revile you what will you do?"
  "I will make no reply," said the mendicant. "And if they strike you?" "I
  will not strike in return," was the reply. "And if they try to kill you?"
  "Death is no evil in itself; many even desire it, to escape from the
  vanities of life, but I shall take no steps either to hasten or to delay
  the time of my departure." These answers were held satisfactory, and the
  monk started on his mission.</p>
      <p>At another time a rich farmer held a harvest home, and the Buddha,
  wishing to preach to him, is said to have taken his alms-bowl and stood
  by the side of the field and begged. The farmer, a wealthy brāhmin,
  said to him, "Why do you come and beg? <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page741">[v.04 p.0741]</ph>I plough and
  sow and earn my food; you should do the same." "I too, O brahmin," said
  the beggar, "plough and sow; and having ploughed and sown I eat." "You
  profess only to be a farmer; no one sees your ploughing, what do you
  mean?" said the brahmin. "For my cultivation," said the beggar, "faith is
  the seed, self-combat is the fertilizing rain, the weeds I destroy are
  the cleaving to existence, wisdom is my plough, and its guiding-shaft is
  modesty; perseverance draws my plough, and I guide it with the rein of my
  mind; the field I work is in the law, and the harvest that I reap is the
  never-dying nectar of Nirvāna, Those who reap this harvest destroy
  all the weeds of sorrow."</p>
      <p>On another occasion he is said to have brought back to her right mind
  a young mother whom sorrow had for a time deprived of reason. Her name
  was Kisāgotamī. She had been married early, as is the custom
  in the East, and had a child when she was still a girl. When the
  beautiful boy could run alone he died. The young girl in her love for it
  carried the dead child clasped to her bosom, and went from house to house
  of her pitying friends asking them to give her medicine for it. But a
  Buddhist convert thinking "she does not understand," said to her, "My
  good girl, I myself have no such medicine as you ask for, but I think I
  know of one who has." "Oh, tell me who that is?" said
  Kisāgotamī. "The Buddha can give you medicine; go to him,"
  was the answer. She went to Gotama; and doing homage to him said, "Lord
  and master, do you know any medicine that will be good for my child?"
  "Yes, I know of some," said the teacher. Now it was the custom for
  patients or their friends to provide the herbs which the doctors
  required; so she asked what herbs he would want. "I want some
  mustard-seed," he said; and when the poor girl eagerly promised to bring
  some of so common a drug, he added, "you must get it from some house
  where no son, or husband, or parent or slave has died." "Very good," she
  said; and went to ask for it, still carrying her dead child with her. The
  people said, "Here is mustard-seed, take it"; but when she asked, "In my
  friend's house has any son died, or a husband, or a parent or slave?"
  They answered, "Lady! what is this that you say? the living are few, but
  the dead are many." Then she went to other houses, but one said "I have
  lost a son," another "We have lost our parents," another "I have lost my
  slave." At last, not being able to find a single house where no one had
  died, her mind began to clear, and summoning up resolution she left the
  dead body of her child in a forest, and returning to the Buddha paid him
  homage. He said to her, "Have you the mustard-seed?" "My lord," she
  replied, "I have not; the people tell me that the living are few, but the
  dead are many." Then he talked to her on that essential part of his
  system, the impermanency of all things, till her doubts were cleared
  away, she accepted her lot, became a disciple, and entered the "first
  path."</p>
      <p>For forty-five years after entering on his mission Gotama itinerated
  in the valley of the Ganges, not going farther than about 250 m. from
  Benares, and always spending the rainy months at one spot—usually
  at one of the <i>viharas</i>,<xref href="#d1e31290/Footnote_298" type="fn"><!--[8]--></xref> or homes, which had been given to
  the society. In the twentieth year his cousin Ānanda became a
  mendicant, and from that time seems to have attended on the Buddha, being
  constantly near him, and delighting to render him all the personal
  service which love and reverence could suggest. Another cousin,
  Devadatta, the son of the rāja of Koli, also joined the society,
  but became envious of the teacher, and stirred up Ajatasattu (who, having
  killed his father Bimbisara, had become king of Rajagaha) to persecute
  Gotama. The account of the manner in which the Buddha is said to have
  overcome the wicked devices of this apostate cousin and his parricide
  protector is quite legendary; but the general fact of Ajatasattu's
  opposition to the new sect and of his subsequent conversion may be
  accepted.</p>
      <p>The confused and legendary notices of the journeyings of Gotama are
  succeeded by tolerably clear accounts of the last few days of his life.<xref href="#d1e31290/Footnote_299" type="fn"><!--[9]--></xref> On a journey
  towards Kusinārā, a town about 120 m. north-north-east of
  Benares, and about 80 m. due east of Kapilavastu, the teacher, being then
  eighty years of age, had rested for a short time in a grove at
  Pāwā, presented to the society by a goldsmith of that place
  named Chunda. Chunda prepared for the mendicants a mid-day meal, and
  after the meal the Buddha started for Kusinārā. He had not
  gone far when he was obliged to rest, and soon afterwards he said,
  "Ānanda, I am thirsty," and they gave him water to drink. Half-way
  between the two towns flows the river Kukushtā. There Gotama rested
  again, and bathed for the last time. Feeling that he was dying, and
  careful lest Chunda should be reproached by himself or others, he said to
  Ānanda, "After I am gone tell Chunda that he will receive in a
  future birth very great reward; for, having eaten of the food he gave me,
  I am about to die; and if he should still doubt, say that it was from my
  own mouth that you heard this. There are two gifts which will be blest
  above all others, namely, Sujātā's gift before I attained
  wisdom under the Bo tree, and this gift of Chunda's before I pass away."
  After halting again and again the party at length reached the river
  Hiranyavati, close by Kusinārā, and there for the last time
  the teacher rested. Lying down under some Sal trees, with his face
  towards the south, he talked long and earnestly with Ānanda about
  his burial, and about certain rules which were to be observed by the
  society after his death. Towards the end of this conversation, when it
  was evening, Ānanda broke down and went aside to weep, but the
  Buddha missed him, and sending for him comforted him with the promise of
  Nirvāna, and repeated what he had so often said before about the
  impermanence of all things,—"O Ānanda! do not weep; do not
  let yourself be troubled. You known what I have said; sooner or later we
  must part from all we hold most dear. This body of ours contains within
  itself the power which renews its strength for a time, but also the
  causes which lead to its destruction. Is there anything put together
  which shall not dissolve? But you, too, shall be free from this delusion,
  this world of sense, this law of change. Beloved," added he, speaking to
  the rest of the disciples, "Ānanda for long years has served me
  with devoted affection." And he spoke to them at some length on the
  kindness of Ānanda.</p>
      <p>About midnight Subhadra, a brahmin philosopher of
  Kusinārā, came to ask some questions of the Buddha, but
  Ānanda, fearing that this might lead to a longer discussion than
  the sick teacher could bear, would not admit him. Gotama heard the sound
  of their talk, and asking what it was, told them to let Subhadra come.
  The latter began by asking whether the six great teachers knew all laws,
  or whether there were some that they did not know, or knew only
  partially. "This is not the time," was the answer, "for such discussions.
  To true wisdom there is only one way, the path that is laid down in my
  system. Many have already followed it, and conquering the lust and pride
  and anger of their own hearts, have become free from ignorance and doubt
  and wrong belief, have entered the calm state of universal kindliness,
  and have reached Nirvāna even in this life. O Subhadra! I do not
  speak to you of things I have not experienced. Since I was twenty-nine
  years old till now I have striven after pure and perfect wisdom, and
  following the good path, have found Nirvāna." A rule had been made
  that no follower of a rival system should be admitted to the society
  without four months' probation. So deeply did the words or the impressive
  manner of the dying teacher work upon Subhadra that he asked to be
  admitted at once, and Gotama granted his request. Then turning to his
  disciples he said, "When I have passed away and am no longer with you, do
  not think that the Buddha has left you, and is not still in your midst.
  You have my words, my explanations of the deep things of truth, the laws
  I have laid down for the society; let them be your guide; the Buddha has
  not left you." Soon afterwards he again spoke to them, urging them to
  reverence one another, and rebuked one of the disciples who spoke <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page742">[v.04
  p.0742]</ph>indiscriminately all that occurred to him. Towards the
  morning he asked whether any one had any doubt about the Buddha, the law
  or the society; if so, he would clear them up. No one answered, and
  Ānanda expressed his surprise that amongst so many none should
  doubt, and all be firmly attached to the law. But the Buddha laid stress
  on the final perseverance of the saints, saying that even the least among
  the disciples who had entered the first path only, still had his heart
  fixed on the way to perfection, and constantly strove after the three
  higher paths. "No doubt," he said, "can be found in the mind of a true
  disciple." After another pause he said: "Behold now, brethren, this is my
  exhortation to you. Decay is inherent in all component things. Work out,
  therefore, your emancipation with diligence!" These were the last words
  the Buddha spoke; shortly afterwards he became unconscious, and in that
  state passed away.</p>

            <i>Note on the
  Date of the Buddha.</i>—The now generally accepted date of the
  Buddha is arrived at by adding together two numbers, one being the date
  of the accession of Asoka to the throne, the second being the length of
  the interval between that date and that of the death of the Buddha. The
  first figure, that of the date of Asoka, is arrived at by the mention in
  one of his edicts of certain Greek kings, as then living. The dates of
  these last are approximately known; and arguing from these dates the date
  of Asoka's accession has been fixed by various scholars (at dates varying
  only by a difference of five years more or less) at about 270 <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph> The second figure, the total interval between
  Asoka's accession and the Buddha's death, is given in the Ceylon
  Chronicles as 218 years. Adding these two together, the date of the
  Buddha's death would be 488 <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph>, and, as he
  was eighty years old at the time of his death, the date of his birth
  would be 568 <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph> The dates for his death and
  birth accepted in Burma, Siam and Ceylon are about half a century
  earlier, namely, 543 and 623 <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph>, the
  difference being in the date of Asoka's accession. It will be seen that
  the dates as adopted in Europe are approximate only, and liable to
  correction if better data are obtainable. The details of this
  chronological question are discussed at length in Professor Rhys Davids'
  <i>Ancient Coins and Measures of Ceylon</i> (London, 1877), where the
  previous discussions are referred to.</fn>
