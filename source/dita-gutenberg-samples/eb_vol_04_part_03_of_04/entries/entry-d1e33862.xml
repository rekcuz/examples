   <title>BUHLE, JOHANN GOTTLIEB</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUHLE, JOHANN GOTTLIEB--> (1763-1821), German scholar and
  philosopher, was born at Brunswick, and educated at Göttingen. He became
  professor of philosophy at Göttingen, Moscow (1840) and Brunswick. Of his
  numerous publications, <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page762">[v.04 p.0762]</ph>the most important are the
  <i>Handbuch der Geschichte der Philosophie</i> (8 vols., 1796-1804), and
  <i>Geschichte der neueren Philosophie</i> (6 vols., 1800-1805). The
  latter, elaborate and well written, is lacking in critical appreciation
  and proportion; there are French and Italian translations. He edited
  Aratus (2 vols., 1793, 1801) and part of Aristotle (Bipontine edition,
  vols. i.-v., 1791-1904).</p>
