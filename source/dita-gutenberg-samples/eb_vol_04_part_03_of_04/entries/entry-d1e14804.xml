   <title>BRITANNICUS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRITANNICUS-->, son of the Roman emperor Claudius by his third
  wife Messallina, was born probably <ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph> 41. He
  was originally called Claudius Tiberius Germanicus, and received the name
  Britannicus from the senate on account of the conquest made in Britain
  about the time of his birth. Till 48, the date of his mother's execution,
  he was looked upon as the heir presumptive; but Agrippina, the new wife
  of Claudius, soon persuaded the feeble emperor to adopt Lucius Domitius,
  known later as Nero, her son by a previous marriage. After the accession
  of Nero, Agrippina, by playing on his fears, induced him to poison
  Britannicus at a banquet (<ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph> 55). A golden
  statue of the young prince was set up by the emperor Titus. Britannicus
  is the subject of a tragedy by Racine.</p>
