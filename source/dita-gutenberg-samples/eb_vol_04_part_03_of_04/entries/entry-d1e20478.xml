      <p><!--BROKE,--> or <ph outputclass="sc">Brooke</ph>, <b>ARTHUR</b> (d.
  1563), English author, wrote the first English version of the story of
  Romeo and Juliet. <i>The Tragicall Historye of Romeus and Julieit</i>
  (1562) is a rhymed account of the story, taken, not directly from
  Bandello's collection of novels (1554), but from the French translation
  (<i>Histoires tragiques</i>) of Pierre Boaistuau or Boisteau, surnamed
  Launay, and Fran√ßois de Belleforest. Broke adds some detail to the story
  as told by Boisteau. As the poem contains many scenes which are not known
  to exist elsewhere, but which were adopted by Shakespeare in <i>Romeo and
  Juliet</i>, there is no reasonable doubt that it may be regarded as the
  main source of the play. Broke perished by shipwreck in 1563, on his way
  from Newhaven to join the English troops fighting on the Huguenot side in
  France.</p>
      <p>The genesis of the Juliet story, and a close comparison of
  Shakespeare's play with Broke's version, are to be found in a reprint of
  the poem and of William Paynter's prose translation from the <i>Palace of
  Pleasure</i>, edited by Mr P. A. Daniel for the New Shakespere Society
  (1875).</p>
