   <body>
      <p><!--BRIARE,--> a town of north-central France in the department of
  Loiret on the right bank of the Loire, 45½ m. S.E. of Orléans on the
  railway to Nevers. Pop. (1906) 4613. Briare, the <i>Brivodorum</i> of the
  Romans, is situated at the extremity of the Canal of Briare, which unites
  the Loire and its lateral canal with the Loing and so with the Seine. The
  canal of Briare was constructed from 1605 to 1642 and is about 36 m.
  long. The industries include the manufacture of fine pottery, and of
  so-called porcelain buttons made of felspar and milk by a special
  process; its inventor, Bapterosses, has a bust in the town. The canal
  traffic is in wood, iron, coal, building materials, &amp;c. A modern
  hospital and church, and the hôtel de ville installed in an old moated
  château, are the chief buildings. The lateral canal of the Loire crosses
  the Loire near Briare by a fine canal-bridge 720 yds. in length.</p>
