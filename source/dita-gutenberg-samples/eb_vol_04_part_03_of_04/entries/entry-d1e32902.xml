   <title>BUDINI</title>

      <p><!--BUDINI,--> an ancient nation in the N.E. of the Scythia
  (<i>q.v.</i>) of Herodotus (iv, 21, 108, 109), probably on the middle
  course of the Volga about Samara. They are described as light-eyed and
  red-haired, and lived by hunting in their thick forests. They were
  probably Finns of the branch now represented by the Votiaks and Permiaks,
  forced northwards by later immigrants. In their country was a wooden city
  inhabited by a distinct race, the Geloni, who seem to have spoken an
  Indo-European tongue. Later writers add nothing to our knowledge, and are
  chiefly interested in the tarandus, an animal which dwelt in the woods of
  the Budini and seems to have been the reindeer (Aristotle ap. Aelian,
  <i>Hist. Anim.</i> xv. 33).</p>
