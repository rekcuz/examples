   <title>BROWN, JOHN</title>

      <p><!--BROWN, JOHN--> (1810-1882), Scottish physician and author, son of
  John Brown (1784-1858), was born at Biggar, Scotland, on the 22nd of
  September 1810. He graduated as M.D. at the university of Edinburgh in
  1833, and practised as a physician in that city. His reputation, however,
  is based on the two volumes of essays, <i>Horae Subsecivae</i> (i.e.
  "leisure hours") (1858, 1861), <i>John Leech and other Papers</i> (1882),
  <i>Rab and His Friends</i> (1859), and <i>Marjorie Fleming: a Sketch</i>
  (1863). The first volume of <i>Horae Subsecivae</i> deals chiefly with
  the equipment and duties of a physician, the second with subjects outside
  his profession. He was emphatic in his belief that an author should
  publish nothing "unless he has something to say, and has done his best to
  say it aright." Acting on this principle, he published little himself,
  and only after subjecting it to the severest criticism. His work is
  invariably characterized by humour and tenderness. He suffered during the
  latter years of his life from pronounced attacks of melancholy, and died
  on the 11th of May 1882.</p>
