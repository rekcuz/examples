   <title>BRITISH EMPIRE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRITISH EMPIRE-->, the name now loosely given to the whole
  aggregate of territory, the inhabitants of which, under various forms of
  government, ultimately look to the British crown as the supreme head. The
  term "empire" is in this connexion obviously used rather for convenience
  than in any sense equivalent to that of the older or despotic empires of
  history.</p>
      <p>The land surface of the earth is estimated to extend over about
  52,500,000 sq. m. Of this area the British empire occupies <ph outputclass="sidenote">Extent.</ph> nearly one-quarter, extending over an
  area of about 12,000,000 sq. m. By far the greater portion lies within
  the temperate zones, and is suitable for white settlement. The notable
  exceptions are the southern half of India and Burma; East, West and
  Central Africa; the West Indian colonies; the northern portion of
  Australia; New Guinea, British Borneo and that portion of North America
  which extends into Arctic regions. The area of the territory of the
  empire is divided almost equally between the southern and the northern
  hemispheres, the great divisions of Australasia and South Africa covering
  between them in the southern hemisphere 5,308,506 sq. m., while the
  United Kingdom, Canada and India, including the native states, cover
  between them in the northern hemisphere 5,271,375 sq. m. The alternation
  of the seasons is thus complete, one-half of the empire enjoying summer,
  while one-half is in winter. The division of territory between the
  eastern and western hemispheres is less equal, Canada occupying alone in
  the western hemisphere 3,653,946 sq. m., while Australasia, South Africa,
  India and the United Kingdom occupy together in the eastern hemisphere
  6,925,975 sq. m. As a matter of fact, however, the eastern portions of
  Australasia border so nearly upon the western hemisphere that the
  distribution of day and night throughout the empire is, like the
  alternations of the seasons, almost complete, one-half enjoying daylight,
  while the other half is in darkness. These alternations of time and of
  seasons, combined with the variety of soils and climates, are calculated
  to have an increasingly important effect upon the material and
  industrial, as well as upon the social and political developments of the
  empire. This will become evident in considering the industrial
  productions of the different divisions, and the harvest seasons which
  permit the summer produce of one portion of the empire to supply the
  winter requirements of its other markets, and conversely.</p>

      <p>The empire contains or is bounded by some of the highest mountains,
  the greatest lakes, and the most important rivers of the world. Its
  climates may be said to include all the known climates of the world; its
  soils are no less various. In the prairies of central Canada it possesses
  some of the most valuable wheat-producing land; in the grass lands of the
  interior of Australia the best pasture country; and in the uplands of
  South Africa the most valuable gold- and diamond-bearing beds which
  exist. The United Kingdom at present produces more coal than any other
  single country except the United States. The effect of climate throughout
  the empire in modifying the type of the Anglo-Saxon race has as yet
  received only partial attention, and conclusions regarding it are of a
  somewhat empiric nature. The general tendency in Canada is held to be
  towards somewhat smaller size, and a hardy active habit; in Australia to
  a tall, slight, pale development locally known as "cornstalkers,"
  characterized by considerable nervous and intellectual activity. In New
  Zealand the type preserves almost exactly the characteristics of the
  British Isles. The South African, both Dutch and British, is readily
  recognized by an apparently sun-dried, lank and hard habit of body. In
  the tropical possessions of the empire, where white settlement does not
  take place to any considerable extent, the individual alone is affected.
  The type undergoes no modification. It is to be observed in reference to
  this interesting aspect of imperial development, that the multiplication
  and cheapening of channels of communication and means of travel
  throughout the empire will tend to modify the future accentuation of race
  difference, while the variety of elements in the vast area occupied
  should have an important, though as yet not scientifically traced, effect
  upon the British imperial type.</p>
     <p>The white population of the empire<xref href="#d1e16323/Footnote_131" type="fn"><!--[1]--></xref> reached in 1901 a total of over
  53,000,000, or something over one-eighth of its entire <ph outputclass="sidenote">Population.</ph> population, which, including native
  races, is estimated at about 400,000,000. The white population includes
  some French, Dutch and Spanish peoples, but is mainly of Anglo-Saxon
  race. It is distributed roughly as follows:—</p>

      <p>The native population of the empire includes types of the principal
  black, yellow and brown races, classing with these the high-type races of
  the East, which may almost be called white. The native population of
  India, mainly high type, brown, was returned at the census of 1901 as
  294,191,379. The population of India is divided into 118 groups on the
  basis of language. These may, however, be collected into the following

         <p>The aboriginal races of South Africa were the Bushmen and Hottentots.
  Both these races are rapidly diminishing in numbers, and in British South
  Africa it is expected that they will in the course of the twentieth
  century become extinct. Besides these primitive races there are the
  dark-skinned negroids of Bantu stock, commonly known in their tribal
  groups as Kaffirs, Zulu, Bechuana and Damara, which are again subdivided
  into many lesser groups. The Bantu compose the greater part of the native
  population. There are also in South Africa Malays and Indians and others,
  who during the last two hundred years have been introduced from Java,
  Ceylon, Madagascar, Mozambique and British India, and by intermarriage
  with each other and with the natives have produced a hybrid population
  generally classed together under the heading of the Mixed Races. These
  are of all colours, varying from yellow to dark brown. The tribes of
  Central Africa are as yet less known. Many of them exhibit racial
  characteristics allied to those of the tribes of South Africa, but with
  in some cases an admixture of Arab blood.</p>

         <p>From east to west across Africa the aboriginal nations are mostly of
  the black negroid type, their varieties being only imperfectly known. The
  tendency of some of the lower negroid types has been to drift towards the
  west coast, where they still practise cannibalistic and fetish rites. On
  the east coast are found much higher types approaching to the Christian
  races of Abyssinia, and from east to west there has been a wide admixture
  of Arab blood producing a light-brown type. In Uganda and Nigeria a large
  proportion of the population is Arab and relatively light-skinned.</p>

         <p>The native races of Australia and the Polynesian groups of islands are
  divided into two main types known as the dark and light Polynesian. The
  dark type, which is black, is of a very low order, and in some of the
  islands still retains its cannibal habits. The aboriginal tribes of
  Australia are of a low-class black race, but generally peaceful and
  inoffensive in their habits. The white Polynesian races are of a very
  superior type, and exhibit, as in the Maoris of New Zealand,
  characteristics of a high order. The natives of Papua (New Guinea) are in
  a very low state of civilization. The estimate given of their numbers is
  approximate, as no census has been taken.</p>

         <p>This is without taking into account the population of the lesser crown
  colonies or allowing for the increase likely to be shown by later
  censuses. Throughout the empire, and notably in the United Kingdom, there
  is among the white races a considerable sprinkling of Jewish blood.</p>
         <p>The latest calculation of the entire population of the world,
  including a liberal estimate of 650,000,000 for peoples not brought under
  any census, gives a total of something over 1,500,000,000. The population
  of the empire may therefore be calculated as amounting to something more
  than one-fourth of the population of the world.</p>
         <p>It is a matter of first importance in the geographical distribution of
  the empire that the five principal divisions, the United <ph outputclass="sidenote">Divisions.</ph> Kingdom, South Africa, India,
  Australia and Canada are separated from each other by the three great
  oceans of the world. The distance as usually calculated in nautical
  miles: from an English port to the Cape of Good Hope is 5840 m.; from the
  Cape of Good Hope to Bombay is 4610; from Bombay to Melbourne is 5630;
  from Melbourne to Auckland is 1830; from Auckland to Vancouver is 6210;
  from Halifax to Liverpool is 2744. From a British port direct to Bombay
  by way of the Mediterranean it is 6272; from a British port by the same
  route to Sydney 11,548 m. These great distances have necessitated the
  acquisition of intermediate ports suitable for coaling stations on the
  trade routes, and have determined the position of many of the lesser
  crown colonies which are held simply for military and commercial
  purposes. Such are the Bermudas, Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, Ceylon, the
  Straits Settlements, Labuan, Hong-Kong, which complete the <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page608">[v.04 p.0608]</ph>chain
  of connexion on the eastern route, and such on other routes are the
  lesser West African stations, Ascension, St. Helena, the Mauritius and
  Seychelles, the Falklands, Tristan da Cunha, and the groups of the
  western Pacific. Other annexations of the British empire have been rocky
  islets of the northern Pacific required for the purpose of telegraph
  stations in connexion with an all-British cable.</p>
         <p>For purposes of political administration the empire falls into the
  three sections of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with
  the dependencies of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man; the Indian
  empire, consisting of British India and the feudatory native states; and
  the colonial empire, comprising all other colonies and dependencies.</p>
         <p>In the modern sense of extension beyond the limits of the United
  Kingdom the growth of the empire is of comparatively <ph outputclass="sidenote">Growth.</ph> recent date. The Channel Islands became
  British as a part of the Norman inheritance of William the Conqueror. The
  Isle of Man, which was for a short time held in conquest by Edward I. and
  restored, was sold by its titular sovereign to Sir William Scrope, earl
  of Wiltshire, in 1393, and by his subsequent attainder for high treason
  and the confiscation of his estates, became a fief of the English crown.
  It was granted by Henry IV. in 1406 to Sir John Stanley, K.C., ancestor
  of the earls of Derby, by whom it was held till 1736, when it passed to
  James Murray, 2nd duke of Atholl, as heir-general of the 10th earl. It
  was inherited by his daughter Charlotte, wife of the 3rd duke of Atholl,
  who sold it to the crown for £70,000 and an annuity of £2000. With these
  exceptions and the nominal possession taken of Newfoundland by Sir
  Humphrey Gilbert in 1583, all the territorial acquisitions of the empire
  have been made in the 17th and subsequent centuries.</p>
         <p>The following is a list of the British colonies and dependencies
  (other than those belonging to the Indian empire) together with a summary
  statement of the date and method of their acquisition. Arranged in
  chronological order they give some idea of the rate of growth of the
  empire. The dates are not, however, in all cases those in which British
  sovereignty was established. They indicate in some instances only the
  first definite step, such as the building of a fort, the opening of a
  trading station, or other act, which led later to the incorporation in
  the empire of the country indicated. In the case of Australian states or
  Canadian provinces originally part of other states or provinces the date
  is that, approximately, of the first settlement of British in the
  district named; <i>e.g.</i> there were British colonists in Saskatchewan
  in the last half of the 18th century, but the province was not
  constituted until 1905. Save where otherwise stated, British authority
  has been continuous from the first date mentioned in the table. Reference
  should be made to the articles on the various colonies.</p>

         <p>In the Pacific are also Bird Island, Bramble Cay, Cato Island, Cook
  Islands, Danger Islands, Ducie Island, Dudosa, Howland Island, Jarvis
  Island, Kermadec Islands, Macquarie Island, Manihiki Islands, Nassau
  Island, Palmerston Island, Palmyra Island, Phoenix Group, Purdy Group,
  Raine Island, Rakaanga Island, Rotumah Island, Surprise Island,
  Washington or New York Island, Willis Group and Wreck Reef.</p>
         <p>In the Indian Ocean there are, besides the colonies already mentioned,
  Rodriguez, the Chagos Islands, St Brandon Islands, Amirante Islands,
  Aldabra, Kuria Muria Islands, Maldive Islands and some other small
  groups.</p>
         <p>In certain dependencies the sovereignty of Great Britain is not
  absolute. The island of Cyprus is nominally still part of the Turkish
  empire, but in 1878 was handed over to Great Britain for occupation and
  administration; Great Britain now making to the Porte on account of the
  island an annual payment of £5000. The administration is in the hands of
  an official styled high commissioner, who is invested with the powers
  usually conferred on a colonial governor. In Zanzibar and other regions
  of equatorial Africa the native rulers retain considerable powers; in the
  Far East certain areas are held on lease from China.</p>
         <p>Egypt, without forming part of the British empire, came under the
  military occupation of Great Britain in 1882. "By right of conquest"
  Great Britain subsequently claimed a share in the administration of the
  former Sudan provinces of Egypt, and an agreement of the 19th of January
  1899 established the joint sovereignty of Great Britain and Egypt over
  what is now known as the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.</p>
         <p>The Indian section of the empire was acquired during the 17th-19th
  centuries under a royal charter granted to the East India Company by
  Queen Elizabeth in 1600. It was transferred to the imperial government in
  1858, and Queen Victoria was proclaimed empress under the Royal Titles
  Act in 1877. The following list gives the dates and method of acquisition
  of the centres of the main divisions of the Indian empire. They have, in
  most instances, grown by general process of extension to their present
  dimensions.</p>

         <p>In addition to these there are British tracts known as the Upper Burma
  frontier and the Burma frontier. There is also a sphere of British
  influence in the border of Afghanistan. The state of Nepal, though
  independent as regards its internal administration, has been since the
  campaign of 1814-15 in close relations with Great Britain. It is bound to
  receive a British resident, and its political relations with other states
  are controlled by the government of India. All these native states have
  come into relative dependency upon Great Britain as a result of conquest
  or of treaty consequent upon the annexation of the neighbouring
  provinces. The settlement of Aden, with its dependencies of Perim and
  Sokotra Island, forms part of the government of Bombay.</p>
         <p>This vast congeries of states, widely different in character, and
  acquired by many different methods, holds together under <ph outputclass="sidenote">Administration.</ph> the supreme headship of the crown
  on a generally acknowledged triple principle of self-government,
  self-support and self-defence. The principle is more fully applied in
  some parts of the empire than in others; there are some parts which have
  not yet completed their political evolution; some others in which the
  principle is temporarily or for special reasons in abeyance; others,
  again—chiefly those of very small extent, which are held for
  purposes of the defence or advantage of the whole—to which it is
  not applicable; but the principle is generally acknowledged as the
  structural basis upon which the constitution of the empire exists.</p>
         <p>In its relation to the empire the home section of the British Isles is
  distinguished from the others as the place of origin of the British race
  and the residence of the crown. The history and constitutional
  development of this portion of the empire will be found fully treated
  under separate headings. (See <ph outputclass="sc">England; Wales; Ireland;
  Scotland; United Kingdom; English History; India; Africa; Australia;
  Canada</ph>; &amp;c.)</p>
         <p>It is enough to say that for purposes of administration the Indian
  empire is divided into nine great provinces and four minor
  commissionerships. The nine great provinces are presided over by two
  governors (Bombay and Madras), five lieut.-governors (Bengal, Eastern
  Bengal and Assam, United Provinces [Agra and Oudh], the Punjab and
  Burma), a chief commissioner (the Central Provinces) and an agent to the
  governor-general (the N.-W. Frontier Province). The four minor
  commissionerships are presided over each by a chief commissioner. Above
  these the supreme executive authority in India is vested in the viceroy
  in council. The council consists of six ordinary members besides the
  existing commander-in-chief. For legislative purposes the
  governor-general's council is increased by the addition of fifteen
  members nominated by the crown, and has power under certain restrictions
  to make laws for British India, for British subjects in the native
  states, and for native Indian subjects of the crown in any part of the
  world. The administration of the Indian empire in England is carried on
  by a secretary of state for India assisted by a council of not less than
  ten members. The expenditure of the revenues is under the control of the
  secretary in council.</p>
         <p>The colonial empire comprises over fifty distinct governments. It is
  divided into colonies of three classes and dependencies; these, again,
  are in some instances associated for administrative purposes in federated
  groups. The three classes of colonies are crown colonies, colonies
  possessing representative institutions but not responsible government,
  and colonies possessing representative institutions and responsible
  government. In crown colonies the crown has entire control of
  legislation, and the public officers are under the control of the home
  government. In representative colonies the crown has only a veto on
  legislation, but the home government retains control of the public
  officers. In responsible colonies the crown retains a veto upon
  legislation, but the home government has no control of any public officer
  except the governor.</p>
         <p>In crown colonies—with the exception of Gibraltar and St Helena,
  where laws may be made by the governor alone—laws are made by the
  governor with the concurrence of a council nominated by the crown. In
  some crown colonies, chiefly those acquired by conquest or cession, the
  authority of this council rests wholly on the crown; in others, chiefly
  those acquired by settlement, the council is created by the crown under
  the authority of local or imperial laws. The crown council of Ceylon may
  be cited as an example of the first kind, and the crown council of
  Jamaica of the second.</p>
         <p>In colonies possessing representative institutions without responsible
  government, the crown cannot (generally) legislate by order in council,
  and laws are made by the governor with the concurrence of the legislative
  body or bodies, one at least of these bodies in cases where a second
  chamber exists possessing a preponderance of elected representatives. The
  Bahamas, Barbados, and Bermuda have two legislative bodies—one
  elected and one nominated by the crown; Malta and the Leeward Islands
  have but one, which is partly elected and partly nominated.</p>
         <p>Under responsible government legislation is carried on by
  parliamentary means exactly as at home, with a cabinet responsible to
  parliament, the crown reserving only a right of veto, which is exercised
  at the discretion of the governor in the case of certain bills. The
  executive councils in those colonies, designated as at home by
  parliamentary choice, are appointed by the governor alone, and the other
  public officers only nominally by the governor on the advice of his
  executive council.</p>
         <p>Colonial governors are classed as governors-general; governors;
  lieut.-governors; administrators; high commissioners; and commissioners,
  according to the status of the colony and dependency, or group of
  colonies and dependencies, over which they preside. Their powers vary
  according to the position which they occupy. In all cases they represent
  the crown.</p>
         <p>As a consequence of this organization the finance of crown colonies is
  under the direct control of the imperial government; the finance of
  representative colonies, though not directly controlled, is usually
  influenced in important departures by the opinion of the imperial
  government. In responsible colonies the finance is entirely under local
  control, and the imperial government is dissociated from either moral or
  material responsibility for colonial debts.</p>
         <p>In federated groups of colonies and dependencies matters which are of
  common interest to a given number of separate governments are by mutual
  consent of the federating communities adjudged to the authority of a
  common government, which, in the case of self-governing colonies, is
  voluntarily created for the purpose. The associated states form under the
  federal government one federal body, but the parts retain control of
  local matters, and exercise all their original rights of government in
  regard to these. The two great self-governing groups of federated
  colonies within the empire are the Dominion of Canada and the
  Commonwealth of Australia. In South Africa unification was preferred to
  federation, the then self-governing colonies being united in 1910 into
  one state—the Union of South Africa. India, of which the associated
  provinces are under the control of the central government, may be given
  as an example of the practical federation of dependencies. Examples <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page611">[v.04
  p.0611]</ph>of federated crown colonies and lesser dependencies are to
  be found in the Leeward Island group of the West Indies and the federated
  Malay States.</p>
         <p>This rough system of self-government for the empire has been evolved
  not without some strain and friction, by the recognition through the
  vicissitudes of three hundred years of the value of independent
  initiative in the development of young countries. Queen Elizabeth's first
  patent to Sir Walter Raleigh permitted British subjects to accompany him
  to America, "with guarantee of a continuance of the enjoyment of all the
  rights which her subjects enjoyed at home."</p>
         <p>This guarantee may presumably have been intended at the time only to
  assure the intending settlers that they should lose no rights of British
  citizenship at home by taking up their residence in America. Its mutual
  interpretation in a wider sense, serving at once to establish in the
  colony rights of citizenship equivalent to those enjoyed in England, and
  to preserve for the colonist the status of British subject at home and
  abroad, has formed in application to all succeeding systems of British
  colonization the unconscious charter of union of the empire.</p>
         <p>The first American colonies were settled under royal grants, each with
  its own constitution. The immense distance in time which in those days
  separated America from Great Britain secured them from interference by
  the home authorities. They paid their own most moderate governing
  expenses, and they contributed largely to their own defence. From the
  middle of the 17th century their trade was not free, but this was the
  only restriction from which they suffered. The great war with France in
  the middle of the 18th century temporarily destroyed this system. That
  war, which resulted in the conquest of Canada and the delivery of the
  North American colonies from French antagonism, cost the imperial
  exchequer £90,000,000. The attempt to avert the repetition of such
  expenditure by the assertion of a right to tax the colonies through the
  British parliament led to the one great rupture which has marked the
  history of the empire. It has to be noted that at home during the latter
  half of the 17th century and the earlier part of the 18th century
  parliamentary power had to a great extent taken the place of the divine
  right of kings. But parliamentary power meant the power of the English
  people and taxpayers. The struggle which developed itself between the
  American colonies and the British parliament was in fact a struggle on
  the part of the people and taxpayers of one portion of the empire to
  resist the domination of the people and taxpayers of another portion. In
  this light it may be accepted as having historically established the
  fundamental axiom of the constitution of the empire, that the crown is
  the supreme head from which the parts take equal dependence.</p>
         <p>The crown requiring advice in the ordinary and constitutional manner
  receives it in matters of colonial administration from the secretaries of
  state for the colonies and for India. After the great rupture separate
  provision in the home government for the administration of colonial
  affairs was at first judged to be unnecessary, and the "Council<xref href="#d1e16904/Footnote_133" type="fn"><!--[3]--></xref> of Trade and
  Plantations," which up to that date had supplied the place now taken by
  the two offices of the colonies and India, was suppressed in 1782. There
  was a reaction from the liberal system of colonial self-government, and
  an attempt was made to govern the colonies simply as dependencies.</p>
         <p>In 1791, not long after the extension of the range of parliamentary
  authority in another portion of the empire, by the creation in 1784 of
  the Board of Control for India, Pitt made the step forward of granting to
  Canada representative institutions, of which the home government kept the
  responsible control. Similar institutions were also given at a later
  period to Australia and South Africa. But the long peace of the early
  part of the 19th century was marked by great colonial developments;
  Australia, Canada and South Africa became important communities.
  Representative institutions controlled by the home government were
  insufficient, and they reasserted the claim for liberty to manage their
  own affairs.</p>
         <p>Fully responsible government was granted to Canada in 1840, and
  gradually extended to the other colonies. In 1854 a separate secretary of
  state for the colonies was appointed at home, and the colonial office was
  established on its present footing. In India, as in the colonies, there
  came with the growing needs of empire a recognition of the true relations
  of the parts to each other and of the whole to the crown. In 1858, on the
  complete transference of the territories of the East India Company to the
  crown, the board of control was abolished, and the India Council, under
  the presidency of a secretary of state for India, was created. It was
  especially provided that the members of the council may not sit in
  parliament.</p>
         <p>Thus, although it has not been found practicable in the working of the
  British constitution to carry out the full theory of the direct and
  exclusive dependence of colonial possessions on the crown, the theory is
  recognized as far as possible. It is understood that the principal
  sections of the empire enjoy equal rights under the crown, and that none
  is subordinate to another. The intervention of the imperial parliament in
  colonial affairs is only admitted theoretically in so far as the support
  of parliament is required by the constitutional advisers of the crown. To
  bring the practice of the empire into complete harmony with the theory it
  would be necessary to constitute, for the purpose of advising the crown
  on imperial affairs, a council in which all important parts of the empire
  should be represented.</p>
         <p>The gradual recognition of the constitutional theory of the British
  empire, and the assumption by the principal <ph outputclass="sidenote">Imperialism.</ph> colonies of full self-governing
  responsibilities, has cleared the way for a movement in favour of a
  further development which should bring the supreme headship of the empire
  more into accord with modern ideas.</p>
         <p>It was during the period of domination of the "Manchester school," of
  which the most effective influence in public affairs was exerted for
  about thirty years, extending from 1845 to 1875, that the fullest
  development of colonial self-government was attained, the view being
  generally accepted at that time that self-governing institutions were to
  be regarded as the preliminary to inevitable separation. A general
  inclination to withdraw from the acceptance of imperial responsibilities
  throughout the world gave to foreign nations at the same time an
  opportunity by which they were not slow to profit, and contributed to the
  force of a reaction of which the part played by Great Britain in the
  scramble for Africa marked the culmination. Under the increasing pressure
  of foreign enterprise, the value of a federation of the empire for
  purposes of common interest began to be discussed. Imperial federation
  was openly spoken of in New Zealand as early as 1852. A similar
  suggestion was officially put forward by the general association of the
  Australian colonies in London in 1857. The Royal Colonial Institution, of
  which the motto "United Empire" illustrates its aims, was founded in
  1868. First among leading British statesmen to repudiate the old
  interpretation of colonial self-government as a preliminary to
  separation, Lord Beaconsfield, in 1872, spoke of the constitutions
  accorded to the colonies as "part of a great policy of imperial
  consolidation." In 1875 W. E. Forster, afterwards a member of the Liberal
  government, made a speech in which he advocated imperial federation as a
  means by which it might become practicable to "replace dependence by
  association." The foundation of the Imperial Federation League—in
  1884, with Forster for its first president, shortly to be succeeded by
  Lord Rosebery—marked a distinct step forward. The Colonial
  Conferences of 1887 and subsequent years (the title being changed to
  Imperial Conference in 1907), in which colonial opinion was sought and
  accepted in respect of important questions of imperial organization and
  defence, and the enthusiastic loyalty displayed by the colonies towards
  the crown on the occasion of the jubilee manifestations of Queen
  Victoria's reign, were further indications of progress in the same
  direction. Coincidently with this development, the achievements of Sir
  George Goldie and Cecil Rhodes, who, the one in West Africa and the other
  in South Africa, added between them to the empire in a space of less than
  twenty years a dominion of greater extent than the whole of British <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page612">[v.04
  p.0612]</ph>India, followed by the action of a host of distinguished
  disciples in other parts of the world, effectually stemmed the movement
  initiated by Cobden and Bright. A tendency which had seemed temporarily
  to point towards a complacent dissolution of the empire was arrested, and
  the closing years of the 19th century were marked by a growing
  disposition to appreciate the value and importance of the unique position
  which the British empire has created for itself in the world. No stronger
  demonstration of the reality of imperial union could be needed than that
  which was afforded by the support given to the imperial forces by the
  colonies and India in the South African War. It remained only to be seen
  by what process of evolution the further consolidation of the empire
  would find expression in the machinery of government. A step in this
  direction was taken in 1907, when at the Colonial Conference held in
  London that year it was decided to form a permanent secretariat to deal
  with the common interests of the self-governing colonies and the
  mother-country. It was further decided that conferences, to be called in
  future Imperial Conferences, between the home government and the
  governments of the self-governing dominions, should be held every four
  years, and that the prime minister of Great Britain should be <i>ex
  officio</i> president of the conference. No executive power was, however,
  conferred upon the conference.</p>
         <p>The movement in favour of tariff reform initiated by Mr Chamberlain
  (<i>q.v.</i>) in 1903 with the double object of giving a preference to
  colonial goods and of protecting imperial trade by the imposition in
  certain cases of retaliative duties on foreign goods, was a natural
  evolution of the imperialist idea, and of the fact that by this time the
  trade-statistics of the United Kingdom had proved that trade with the
  colonies was forming an increasingly large proportion of the whole. In
  spite of the defeat of the Unionist party in England in 1906, and the
  accession to power of a Liberal government opposed to anything which
  appeared to be inconsistent with free trade, the movement for colonial
  preference, based on tariff reform, continued to make headway in the
  United Kingdom, and was definitely adopted by the Unionist party. And at
  the Imperial Conference of 1907 it was advocated by all the colonial
  premiers, who could point to the progress made in their own states
  towards giving a tariff preference to British goods and to those of one
  another.</p>
         <p>The question of self-government is closely associated with the
  question of self-support. Plenty of good land and the liberty to manage
  their own affairs were the causes assigned by Adam Smith for the marked
  prosperity of the British colonies towards the end of the 18th century.
  The same causes are still observed to produce the same effects, and it
  may be pointed out that, since the date of the latest of Adam Smith's
  writings, upwards of 6,000,000 sq. m. of virgin soil, rich with
  possibilities of agricultural, pastoral and mineral wealth, have been
  added to the empire. In the same period the white population has grown
  from about 12,000,000 to 53,000,000, and the developments of agricultural
  and industrial machinery have multiplied, almost beyond computation, the
  powers of productive labour.</p>
         <p>It is scarcely possible within this article to deal with so widely
  varied a subject as that of the productions and industry of the <ph outputclass="sidenote">The imperial factor in industry and trade.</ph>
  empire. For the purposes of a general statement, it is interesting to
  observe that concurrently with the acquisition of the vast continental
  areas during the 19th century, the progress of industrial science in
  application to means of transport and communication brought about a
  revolution of the most radical character in the accepted laws of economic
  development. Railways did away with the old law that the spread of
  civilization is necessarily governed by facilities for water carriage and
  is consequently confined to river valleys and sea-shores. Steam and
  electricity opened to industry the interior of continents previously
  regarded as unapproachable. The resources of these vast inland spaces
  which have lain untouched since history began became available to
  individual enterprise, and over a great portion of the earth's surface
  were brought within the possessions of the British empire. The production
  of raw material within the empire increased at a rate which can only be
  appreciated by a careful study of figures, and by a comparison of the
  total of these figures with the total figures of the world. The tropical
  and temperate possessions of the empire include every field of production
  which can be required for the use of man. There is no main staple of
  human food which is not grown; there is no material of textile industry
  which is not produced. The British empire gives occupation to more than
  one-third of the persons employed in mining and quarrying in the world.
  It may be interesting, as an indication of the relative position in this
  respect of the British empire to the world, to state that at present it
  produces one-third of the coal supply of the world, one-sixth of the
  wheat supply, and very nearly two-thirds of the gold supply. But while
  these figures may be taken as in themselves satisfactory, it is far more
  important to remember that as yet the potential resources of the new
  lands opened to enterprise have been barely conceived, and their wealth
  has been little more than scratched. Population as yet has been only very
  sparsely sprinkled over the surface of many of the areas most suitable
  for white settlement. In the wheat lands of Canada, the pastoral country
  of Australasia, and the mineral fields of South Africa and western Canada
  alone, the undeveloped resources are such as to ensure employment to the
  labour and satisfaction to the needs of at least as many millions as they
  now contain thousands of the British race. In respect of this promise of
  the future the position of the British empire is unique.</p>
         <p>It is not too much to say that trade has been at once the most active
  cause of expansion and the most potent bond of union in the development
  of the empire. Trade with the tropical and settlement in the temperate
  regions of the world formed the basis upon which the foundations of the
  empire were laid. Trading companies founded most of the American and West
  Indian colonies; a trading company won India; a trading company colonized
  the north-western districts of Canada; commercial wars during the greater
  part of the 18th century established the British command of the sea,
  which rendered the settlement of Australasia possible. The same wars gave
  Great Britain South Africa, and chartered companies in the 19th century
  carried the British flag into the interior of the African continent from
  south and east and west. Trading companies developed Borneo and Fiji. The
  bonds of prosperous trade have kept the Australasian colonies within the
  empire. The protection of colonial commerce by the imperial navy is one
  of the strongest of material links which connect the crown with the
  outlying possessions of the empire.</p>
         <p>The trade of the empire, like the other developments of imperial
  public life, has been profoundly influenced by the variety of <ph outputclass="sidenote">Imperial trade policy.</ph> local conditions under
  which it has flourished. In the early settlement of the North American
  colonies their trade was left practically free; but by the famous
  Navigation Act of 1660 the importation and exportation of goods from
  British colonies were restricted to British ships, of which the master
  and three-fourths of the mariners were English. This act, of which the
  intention was to encourage British shipping and to keep the monopoly of
  British colonial trade for the benefit of British merchants, was followed
  by many others of a similar nature up to the time of the repeal of the
  Corn Laws in 1846 and the introduction of free trade into Great Britain.
  The Navigation Acts were repealed in 1849. Thus for very nearly two
  hundred years British trade was subject to restrictions, of which the
  avowed intention was to curtail the commercial intercourse of the empire
  with the world. During this period the commercial or mercantile system,
  of which the fallacies were exposed by the economists of the latter half
  of the 18th century, continued to govern the principles of British trade.
  Under this system monopolies were common, and among them few were more
  important than that of the East India Company. In 1813 the trade of India
  was, however, thrown open to competition, and in 1846, after the
  introduction of free trade at home, the principal British colonies which
  had not yet at that date received the grant of responsible government
  were specially empowered to abolish differential duties upon foreign
  trade. A first result of the commercial emancipation of the <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page613">[v.04
  p.0613]</ph>colonies was the not altogether unnatural rise in the
  manufacturing centres of the political school known as the Manchester
  school, which was disposed to question the value to Great Britain of the
  retention of colonies which were no longer bound to give her the monopoly
  of their commercial markets. An equally natural desire on the part of the
  larger colonies to profit by the opportunity which was opened to them of
  establishing local manufactures of their own, combined with the
  convenience in new countries of using the customs as an instrument of
  taxation, led to something like a reciprocal feeling of resentment, and
  there followed a period during which the policy of Great Britain was to
  show no consideration for colonial trade, and the policy of the principal
  colonies was to impose heavy duties upon British trade. By a gradual
  process of better understanding, largely helped by the development of
  means of communication, the antagonistic extreme was abandoned, and a
  tendency towards a system of preferential duties within the empire
  displayed itself.</p>
         <p>At the Colonial Conference held in London in 1887 a proposal was
  formally submitted by the South <ph outputclass="sidenote">Colonial
  preference.</ph> African delegate for the establishment within the
  empire of a preferential system, imposing a duty of 2% upon all foreign
  goods, the proceeds to be directed to the maintenance of the imperial
  navy. To this end it was requested that certain treaties with foreign
  nations which imposed restrictions on the trade of various parts of the
  empire with each other should be denounced. Some years later, a strong
  feeling having been manifested in England against any foreign engagement
  standing in the way of new domestic trade arrangements between a colony
  and the mother-country, the German and Belgian treaties in question were
  denounced (1897). Meanwhile, simultaneously with the movement in favour
  of reciprocal fiscal advantages to be granted within the empire by the
  many local governments to each other, there was a growth of the
  perception that an increase of the foreign trade of Great Britain,
  carried on chiefly in manufactured goods, was accompanied by a
  corresponding enlargement of the home markets for colonial raw material,
  and consequently that injury to the foreign trade of Great Britain, while
  as yet it so largely outweighed the trade between the United Kingdom and
  the colonies, must necessarily react upon the colonies. This view was
  definitely expressed at the Colonial Conference at Ottawa in 1894, and
  was one of the factors which led to the relinquishment of the demand that
  in return for colonial concessions there should be an imposition on the
  part of Great Britain of a differential duty upon foreign goods. Canada
  was the first important British colony to give substantial expression to
  the new imperial sentiment in commercial matters by the introduction in
  1897 of an imperial tariff, granting without any reciprocal advantage a
  deduction of 25% upon customs duties imposed upon British goods. The same
  advantage was offered to all British colonies trading with her upon equal
  terms. In later years the South African states, Australia and New Zealand
  also granted preferential treatment to British goods. Meanwhile in Great
  Britain the system of free imports, regarded as "free trade" (though only
  one-sided free trade), had become the established policy, customs duties
  being only imposed for purposes of revenue on a few selected articles,
  and about half the national income was derived from customs and excise.
  In most of the colonies customs form of necessity one of the important
  sources of revenue. It is, however, worthy of remark that in the
  self-governing colonies, even those which are avowedly protectionist, a
  smaller proportion of the public revenue was derived from customs and
  excise than was derived from these sources in the United Kingdom. The
  proportion in Australasia before federation was about one quarter. In
  Canada it is more difficult to estimate it, as customs and excise form
  the principal provision made for federal finance, and note must therefore
  be taken of the separate sources of revenue in the provinces. With these
  reservations it will still be seen that customs, or, in other words, a
  tax upon the movements of trade, forms one of the chief sources of
  imperial revenue.</p>
         <p>The development of steam shipping and electricity gave to the
  movements of trade a stimulus no less remarkable than that given by the
  introduction of railroads and industrial machinery to production and
  manufactures. Whereas at the beginning of the 19th century the journey to
  Australia occupied eight months, and business communications between
  Sydney and London could not receive answers within the year, at the
  beginning of the 20th century the journey could be accomplished in
  thirty-one days, and telegraphic despatches enabled the most important
  business to be transacted within twenty-four hours. For one cargo carried
  in the year at the beginning of the 19th century at least six could now
  be carried by the same ship, and from the point of view of trade the
  difference of a venture which realizes its profits in two months, as
  compared with one which occupied a whole year, does not need to be
  insisted on. The increased rapidity of the voyage and the power of daily
  communication by telegraph with the most distant markets have introduced
  a wholly new element into the national trade of the empire, and
  commercial intercourse between the southern and the northern hemispheres
  has received a development from the natural alternation of the seasons,
  of which until quite recent years the value was not even conceived.
  Fruit, eggs, butter, meat, poultry and other perishable commodities pass
  in daily increasing quantities between the northern and the southern
  hemispheres with an alternate flow which contributes to raise in no
  inconsiderable degree the volume of profitable trade. Thus the butter
  season of Australasia is from October to March, while the butter season
  of Ireland and northern Europe is from March to October. In three years
  after the introduction of ice-chambers into the steamers of the great
  shipping lines, Victoria and New South Wales built up a yearly butter
  trade of £1,000,000 with Great Britain without seriously affecting the
  Irish and Danish markets whence the summer supply is drawn. These
  facilities, combined with the enormous additions made to the public stock
  of land and labour, contributed to raise the volume of trade of the
  empire from a total of less than £100,000,000 in the year 1800 to a total
  of nearly £1,500,000,000 in 1900. The declared volume of British exports
  to all parts of the world in 1800 was £38,120,120, and the value of
  British imports from all parts of the world was £30,570,605; total,
  £68,690,725. As in those days the colonies were not allowed to trade with
  any other country this must be taken as representing imperial trade. The
  exact figures of the trade of India, the colonies, and the United Kingdom
  for 1900 were: imports, £809,178,209; exports, £657,899,363; total,
  £1,467,077,572.</p>
         <p>A question of sovereign importance to the continued existence of the
  empire is the question of defence. A country of which <ph outputclass="sidenote">Imperial defence.</ph> the main thoroughfares are the
  oceans of the world demands in the first instance a strong navy. It has
  of late years been accepted as a fundamental axiom of defence that the
  British navy should exceed in strength any reasonable combination of
  foreign navies which could be brought against it, the accepted formula
  being the "two-power standard," <i>i.e.</i> a 10% margin over the joint
  strength of the two next powers. The expense of maintaining such a
  floating armament must be colossal, and until within the decade 1890-1900
  it was borne exclusively by the taxpayers of the United Kingdom. As the
  benefits of united empire have become more consciously appreciated in the
  colonies, and the value of the fleet as an insurance for British commerce
  has been recognized, a desire has manifested itself on the part of the
  self-governing colonies to contribute towards the formation of a truly
  imperial navy. In 1895 the Australasian colonies voted a subsidy of
  £126,000 per annum for the maintenance of an Australasian squadron, and
  in 1897 the Cape Colony also offered a contribution of £30,000 a year to
  be used at the discretion of the imperial government for naval purposes.
  The Australian contribution was in 1902 increased to £240,000, and that
  of the Cape to £50,000, while Natal voted £35,000 a year and Newfoundland
  £3000. But apart from these comparatively slight contributions, and the
  local up-keep of colonial fortifications,—and the beginning in
  1908-1909 of an Australian torpedo-boat flotilla provided by the
  Commonwealth,—the whole cost of the imperial navy, on which
  ultimately the security of the empire rested, remained to be <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page614">[v.04
  p.0614]</ph>borne by the taxpayers in the British islands. The extent
  of this burden was emphasized in 1909 by the revelations as to the
  increase of the German (and the allied Austrian) fleet. At this crisis in
  the history of the two-power standard a wave of enthusiasm started in the
  colonies, resulting in the offer of "Dreadnoughts" from New Zealand and
  elsewhere; and the British government called an Imperial Conference to
  consider the whole question afresh.</p>
         <p>Land defence, though a secondary branch of the great question of
  imperial defence, has been intimately connected with the development and
  internal growth of the empire. In the case of the first settlement of the
  American colonies they were expected to provide for their own land
  defence. To some extent in the early part of their career they carried
  out this expectation, and even on occasion, as in the taking of
  Louisburg, which was subsequently given back at the peace of
  Aix-la-Chapelle as the price of the French evacuation of Madras, rendered
  public service to the empire at large. In India the principle of local
  self-defence was from the beginning carried into practice by the East
  India Company. But in America the claim of the French wars proved too
  heavy for local resources. In 1755 Great Britain intervened with troops
  sent from home under General Braddock, and up to the outbreak of the
  American War the cost of the defence of the North American colonies was
  borne by the imperial exchequer. To meet this expense the imperial
  parliament took upon itself the right to tax the American colonies. In
  1765 a Quartering Act was passed by which 10,000 imperial troops were
  quartered in the colonies. As a result of the American War which followed
  and led to the loss of the colonies affected, the imperial authorities
  accepted the charge of the land defences of the empire, and with the
  exception of India and the Hudson Bay territories, where the trading
  companies determined to pay their own expenses, the whole cost of
  imperial defence was borne, like the cost of the navy, by the taxpayers
  of the United Kingdom. This condition of affairs lasted till the end of
  the Napoleonic Wars. During the thirty years' peace which followed there
  came time for consideration. The fiscal changes which towards the middle
  of the 19th century gave to the self-governing colonies the command of
  their own resources very naturally carried with them the consequence that
  a call should be made on colonial exchequers to provide for their own
  governing expenses. Of these defence is obviously one of the most
  essential. Coincidently, therefore, with the movements of free trade at
  home, the renunciation of what was known as the mercantile system and the
  accompanying grants of constitutional freedom to the colonies, a movement
  for the reorganization of imperial defence was set on foot. In the decade
  which elapsed between 1846 and 1856 the movement as regards the colonies
  was confined chiefly to calls made upon them to contribute to their own
  defence by providing barracks, fortifications, &amp;c., for the
  accommodation of imperial troops, and in some cases paying for the use of
  troops not strictly required for imperial purposes. In 1857 the
  Australian colonies agreed to pay the expenses of the imperial garrison
  quartered in Australia. This was a very wide step from the imperial
  attempt to tax the American colonies for a similar purpose in the
  preceding century. Nevertheless, in evidence given before a departmental
  committee in 1859, it was shown that at that time the colonies of Great
  Britain were free from almost every obligation of contributing either by
  personal service or money payment towards their own defence, and that the
  cost of military expenditure in the colonies in the preceding year had
  amounted in round figures to £4,000,000. A committee of the House of
  Commons sat in 1861 to consider the question, and in 1862 it was
  resolved, without a division, that "colonies exercising the right of
  self-government ought to undertake the main responsibility of providing
  for their own internal order and security, and ought to assist in their
  own external defence." The decision was accepted as the basis of imperial
  policy. The first effect was the gradual withdrawing of imperial troops
  from the self-governing colonies, together with the encouragement of the
  development of local military systems by the loan, when desired, of
  imperial military experts. A call was also made for larger military
  contributions from some of the crown colonies. The committee of 1859 had
  emphasized in its report the fact that the principal dependence of the
  colonies for defence is necessarily upon the British navy, and in 1865,
  exactly 100 years after the Quartering Act, which had been the cause of
  the troubles that led to the independence of the United States, a
  Colonial Naval Defence Act was passed which gave power to the colonies to
  provide ships of war, steamers, and volunteers for their own defence, and
  in case of necessity to place them at the disposal of the crown. In 1868
  the Canadian Militia Act gave the fully organized nucleus of a local army
  to Canada. In the same year the imperial troops were withdrawn from New
  Zealand, leaving the colonial militia to deal with the native war still
  in progress. In 1870 the last imperial troops were withdrawn from
  Australia, and in 1873 it was officially announced that military
  expenditure in the colonies was almost "wholly for imperial purposes." In
  1875 an imperial officer went to Australia to report for the Australian
  government upon Australian defence. The appointment in 1879 of a royal
  commission to consider the question of imperial defence, which presented
  its report in 1882, led to a considerable development and reorganization
  of the system of imperial fortifications. Coaling stations were also
  selected with reference to the trade routes. In 1885 rumours of war
  roused a very strong feeling in connexion with the still unfinished and
  in many cases unarmed condition of the fortifications recommended by the
  commission of 1879. Military activity was stimulated throughout the
  empire, and the Colonial Defence Committee was created to supply a
  much-felt need for organized direction and advice to colonial
  administrations acting necessarily in independence of each other. The
  question of colonial defence was among the most important of the subjects
  discussed at the colonial conference held in London in 1887, and it was
  at this conference that the Australasian colonies first agreed to
  contribute to the expense of their own naval defence. From this date the
  principle of local responsibility for self-defence has been fully
  accepted. India has its own native army, and pays for the maintenance
  within its frontiers of an imperial garrison. Early in the summer of
  1899, when hostilities in South Africa appeared to be imminent, the
  governments of the principal colonies took occasion to express their
  approval of the South African policy pursued by the imperial government,
  and offers were made by the governments of India, the Australasian
  colonies, Canada, Hong-Kong, the Federal Malay states, some of the West
  African and other colonies, to send contingents for active service in the
  event of war. On the outbreak of hostilities these offers, on the part of
  the self-governing colonies, were accepted, and colonial contingents
  upwards of 30,000 strong were among the most efficient sections of the
  British fighting force. The manner in which these colonial contingents
  were raised, their admirable fighting qualities, and the service rendered
  by them in the field, disclosed altogether new possibilities of military
  organization within the empire, and in subsequent years the subject
  continued to engage the attention of the statesmen of the empire.
  Progress in this field lay chiefly in the increased support given in the
  colonial states to the separate local movements for self-defence; but in
  1909 a scheme was arranged by Mr Haldane, by which the British War Office
  should co-operate with the colonial governments in providing for the
  training of officers and an interchange of views on a common military
  policy.</p>
         <p>The important questions of justice, religion and instruction will be
  found dealt with in detail under the headings of separate <ph outputclass="sidenote">Justice, &amp;c.</ph> sections of the empire. Systems
  of justice throughout the empire have a close resemblance to each other,
  and the judicial committee of the privy council, on which the
  self-governing colonies and India are represented, constitutes a supreme
  court of appeal (<i>q.v.</i>) for the entire empire. In the matter of
  religion, while no imperial organization in the strict sense is possible,
  the progress made by the Lambeth Conferences and otherwise (see <ph outputclass="sc">Anglican Communion</ph>) has done much to bring the work of
  the Church of England in different parts of the world into a co-operative
  system. Religion, of which the forms are infinitely varied, is however
  everywhere free, <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page615">[v.04 p.0615]</ph>except in cases where the exercise
  of religious rites leads to practices foreign to accepted laws of
  humanity. It is perhaps interesting to state that the number of persons
  in the empire nominally professing the Christian religion is 58,000,000,
  of Mahommedans 94,000,000, of Buddhists 12,000,000, of Hindus
  208,000,000, of pagans and others 25,000,000. Systems of instruction, of
  which the aim is generally similar in the white portions of the empire
  and is directed towards giving to every individual the basis of a liberal
  education, are governed wholly by local requirements. Native schools are
  established in all settled communities under British rule.</p>

            <ph outputclass="sc">Literature</ph>.—In recent years the subject
  of British imperialism has inspired a growing literature, and it is only
  possible here to name a selected number of the more important works which
  may usefully be consulted on different topics: Sir C.P. Lucas,
  <i>Historical Geography of the British Colonies</i> (1888, et seq.); H.E.
  Egerton, <i>Short History of British Colonial Policy</i> (1897); H.J.
  Mackinder, <i>Britain and the British Seas</i> (1902); Sir J.R. Seeley,
  <i>Expansion of England</i> (1883); <i>Growth of British Policy</i>
  (1895); Sir Charles Dilke, <i>Greater Britain</i> (1869), <i>Problems of
  Greater Britain</i> (1890), <i>The British Empire</i> (1899); G.R.
  Parkin, <i>Imperial Federation</i> (1892); Sir John Colomb, <i>Imperial
  Federation, Naval and Military</i> (1886); Sir G.S. Clarke, <i>Imperial
  Defence</i> (1897); Sidney Goldmann and others, <i>The Empire and the
  Century</i> (1905); J.L. Garvin, <i>Imperial Reciprocity</i> (1903); J.W.
  Welsford, <i>The Strength of a Nation</i> (1907); <i>Compatriots Club
  Essays</i> (1906); Sir H. Jenkyns, <i>British Rule and Jurisdiction
  beyond the Seas</i> (1902); Bernard Holland, <i>Imperium et libertas</i>
  (1901); (for an anti-imperialist view) J.A. Hobson, <i>Imperialism</i>
  (1902). See also the Reports of the various colonial conferences,
  especially that of the Imperial Conference of 1907; and for trade
  statistics, J. Holt Schooling's <i>British Trade Book</i>. For the tariff
