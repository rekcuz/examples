   <title>BRIDGEPORT</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIDGEPORT-->, a city, a port of entry, and one of the
  county-seats of Fairfield county, Connecticut, U.S.A., co-extensive with
  the town of Bridgeport, in the S.W. part of the state, on Long Island
  Sound, at the mouth of the Pequonnock river; about 18 m. S.W. of New
  Haven. Pop. (1880) 27,643; (1890) 48,866; (1900) 70,996, of whom 22,281
  were foreign-born, including 5974 from Ireland, 3172 from Hungary, 2854
  from Germany, 2755 from England, and 1436 from Italy; (1910) 102,054.
  Bridgeport is served by the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford railway,
  by lines of coast steamers, and by steamers to New York City and to Port
  Jefferson, directly across Long Island Sound. The harbour, formed by the
  estuary of the river and Yellow Mill Pond, an inlet, is excellent.
  Between the estuary and the pond is a peninsula, East Bridgeport, in
  which are some of the largest manufacturing establishments, and west of
  the harbour and the river is the main portion of the city, the wholesale
  section extending along the bank, the retail section farther back, and
  numerous factories along the line of the railway far to the westward.
  There are two large parks, Beardsley, in the extreme north part of the
  city, and Seaside, west of the harbour entrance and along the Sound; in
  the latter are statues of Elias Howe, who built a large sewing-machine
  factory here in 1863, and of P.T. Barnum, the showman, who lived in
  Bridgeport after 1846 and did much for the city, especially for East
  Bridgeport. In Seaside Park there is also a soldiers' and sailors'
  monument, and in the vicinity are many fine residences. The principal
  buildings are the St Vincent's and Bridgeport hospitals, the Protestant
  orphan asylum, the Barnum Institute, occupied by the Bridgeport
  Scientific and Historical Society and the Bridgeport Medical Society; and
  the United States government building, which contains the post-office and
  the customs house.</p>
      <p>In 1905 Bridgeport was the principal manufacturing centre in
  Connecticut, the capital invested in manufacturing being $49,381,348, and
  the products being valued at $44,586,519. The largest industries were the
  manufacture of corsets—the product of Bridgeport was 19.9% of the
  total for the United States in 1905, Bridgeport being the leading city in
  this industry—sewing machines (one of the factories of the Singer
  Manufacturing Co. is here), steam-fitting and heating apparatus,
  cartridges (the factory of the Union Metallic Cartridge Co. is here),
  automobiles, brass goods, phonographs and gramophones, and typewriters.
  There are also large foundry and machine shops. Here, too, are the winter
  headquarters of "Barnum and Bailey's circus" and of "Buffalo Bill's Wild
  West Show." Bridgeport is a port of entry; its imports in 1908 were
  valued at $656,271. Bridgeport was originally a part of the township of
  Stratford. The first settlement here was made in 1659. It was called
  Pequonnock until 1695, when its name was changed to Stratfield. During
  the War of Independence it was a centre of privateering. In 1800 the
  borough of Bridgeport was chartered, and in 1821 the township was
  incorporated. The city was not chartered until 1836.</p>
