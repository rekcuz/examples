      <p><!--BRÉTIGNY,--> a French town (dept. Eure-et-Loir, arrondissement and
  canton of Chartres, commune of Sours), which gave its name to a
  celebrated treaty concluded there on the 8th of May 1360, between Edward
  III. of England and John II., surnamed the Good, of France. The exactions
  of the English, who wished to yield as few as possible of the advantages
  claimed by them in the treaty of London, made negotiations difficult, and
  the discussion of terms begun early in April lasted more than a month. By
  virtue of this treaty Edward III. obtained, besides Guienne and Gascony,
  Poitou, Saintonge and Aunis, Agenais, Périgord, Limousin, Quercy,
  Bigorre, the countship of Gaure, Angoumois, Rouergue, Montreuil-sur-mer,
  Ponthieu, Calais, Sangatte, Ham and the countship of Guines. John II.
  had, moreover, to pay three millions of gold crowns for his ransom. On
  his side the king of England gave up the duchies of Normandy and
  Touraine, the countships of Anjou and Maine, and the suzerainty of
  Brittany and of Flanders. As a guarantee for the payment of his ransom,
  John the Good gave as hostages two of his sons, several princes and
  nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the
  nineteen principal towns of France. This treaty was ratified and sworn to
  by the two kings and by their eldest sons on the 24th of October 1360, at
  Calais. At the same time were signed the special conditions relating to
  each important article of the treaty, and the renunciatory clauses in
  which the kings abandoned their rights over the territory they had
  yielded to one another.</p>
