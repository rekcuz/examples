      <p><!--BROOM,--> known botanically as <i>Cytisus</i>, or <i>Sarothamnus,
  scoparius</i>, a member of the natural order Leguminosae, a shrub found
  on heaths and commons in the British Isles, and also in Europe (except
  the north) and temperate Asia. The leaves are small, and the function of
  carbon-assimilating is shared by the green stems. The bright yellow
  flowers scatter their pollen by an explosive mechanism; the weight of a
  bee alighting on the flower causes the keel to split and the pollen to be
  shot out on to the insect's body. When ripe the black pods explode with a

  twigs have a bitter and nauseous taste and have long had a popular
  reputation as a diuretic; the seeds have similar properties.</p>
      <p>"Butcher's broom," a very different plant, known botanically as
  <i>Ruscus aculeatus</i>, is a member of the natural order Liliaceae. It
  is a small evergreen shrub found in copses and woods, but rare in the
  southern half of England. The stout angular stems bear leaves reduced to
  small scales, which subtend flattened leaf-like branches (cladodes) with
  a sharp apex. The small whitish flowers are borne on the face of the
  cladodes, and are succeeded by a bright red berry.</p>
