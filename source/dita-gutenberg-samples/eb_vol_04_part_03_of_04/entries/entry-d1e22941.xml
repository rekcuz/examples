      <p><!--BROUGHAM,--> a four-wheeled closed carriage, seating two or more
  persons, and drawn by a single horse or pair, or propelled by motor. The
  modern "brougham" has developed and taken its name from the "odd little
  kind of garden-chair" described by Thomas Moore, which the first Lord
  Brougham had made by a coachmaker to his own design.</p>
