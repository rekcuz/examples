   <title>BRIQUETTE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIQUETTE--> (diminutive of Fr. <i>brique</i>, brick), a form of
  fuel, known also as "patent fuel," consisting of small coal compressed
  into solid blocks by the aid of some binding material. For making
  briquettes the small coal, if previously washed, is dried to reduce the
  moisture to at most 4%, and if necessary crushed in a disintegrator. It
  is then incorporated in a pug mill with from 8 to 10% of gas pitch, and
  softened by heating to between 70° and 90° C. to a plastic mass, which is
  moulded into blocks and compacted by a pressure of ½ to 2 tons per sq.
  in. in a machine with a rotating die-plate somewhat like that used in
  making semi-plastic clay bricks. When cold, the briquettes, which usually
  weigh from 7 to 20 lb each, although smaller sizes are made for domestic
  use, become quite hard, and can be handled with less breakage than the
  original coal. Their principal use is as fuel for marine and locomotive
  boilers, the evaporative value being about the same as, or somewhat
  greater than, that of coal. The principal seat of the manufacture in
  Great Britain is in South Wales, where the dust and smalls resulting from
  the handling of the best steam coals (which are very brittle) are
  obtainable in large quantities and find no other use. Some varieties of
  lignite, when crushed and pressed at a steam heat, soften sufficiently to
  furnish compact briquettes without requiring any cementing material.
  Briquettes of this kind are made to a large extent from the tertiary
  lignites in the vicinity of Cologne; they are used mainly for house fuel
  on the lower Rhine and in Holland, and occasionally come to London.</p>
