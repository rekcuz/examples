   <title>BRINDLEY, JAMES</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRINDLEY, JAMES--> (1716-1772), English engineer, was born at
  Thornsett, Derbyshire, in 1716. His parents were in very humble
  circumstances, and he received little or no education. At the age of
  seventeen he was apprenticed to a millwright near Macclesfield, and soon
  after completing his apprenticeship he set up in business for himself as
  a wheelwright at Leek, quickly becoming known for his ingenuity and skill
  in repairing all kinds of machinery. In 1752 he designed and set up an
  engine for draining some coal-pits at Clifton in Lancashire. Three years
  later he extended his reputation by completing the machinery for a
  silk-mill at Congleton. In 1759, when the duke of Bridgewater was anxious
  to improve the outlets for the coal on his estates, Brindley advised the
  construction of a canal from Worsley to Manchester. The difficulties in
  the way were great, but all were surmounted by his genius, and his
  crowning triumph was the construction of an aqueduct to carry the canal
  at an elevation of 39 ft. over the river Irwell at Barton. The great
  success of this canal encouraged similar projects, and Brindley was soon
  engaged in extending his first work to the Mersey, at Runcorn. He then
  designed and nearly completed what he called the Grand Trunk Canal,
  connecting the Trent and Humber with the Mersey. The Staffordshire and
  Worcestershire, the Oxford and the Chesterfield Canals were also planned
  by him, and altogether he laid out over 360 m. of canals. He died at
  Turnhurst, Staffordshire, on the 30th of September 1772. Brindley
  retained to the last a peculiar roughness of character and demeanour; but
  his innate power of thought more than compensated for his lack of
  training. It is told of him that when in any difficulty he used to retire
  to bed, and there remain thinking out his problem until the solution
  became clear to him. His mechanical ingenuity and fertility of resource
  were very remarkable, and he undoubtedly possessed the engineering
  faculty in a very high degree. He was an enthusiastic believer in canals,
  and his reported answer, when asked the use of navigable rivers, "To feed
  canals," is characteristic, if not altogether authentic.</p>
