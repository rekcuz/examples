   <title>BRIDGEND</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIDGEND-->, a market town in the southern parliamentary division
  of Glamorganshire, Wales, on both sides of the river Ogwr (whence its
  Welsh name Penybont-ar-Ogwr). Pop. of urban district (1901) 6062. It has
  a station 165 m. from London on the South Wales trunk line of the Great
  Western railway, and is the junction of the Barry Company's railway to
  Barry via Llantwit Major. Bridgend has a good market for agricultural
  produce, and is an important centre owing to its being the natural outlet
  for the mining valleys of the Llynvi, Garw and the two Ogwr rivers, which
  converge about 3 m. north of the town and are connected with it by branch
  lines of the Great Western railway. Though without large manufacturing
  industries, the town has joinery works, a brass and iron foundry, a
  tannery and brewery. There are brick-works and stone quarries, and much
  lime is burnt in the neighbourhood. Just outside the town at Angelton and
  Parc Gwyllt are the Glamorgan county lunatic asylums.</p>
      <p>There was no civil parish of Bridgend previous to 1905, when one was
  formed out of portions of the parishes of Newcastle and Coity. Of the
  castle of Newcastle, built on the edge of a cliff above the church of
  that parish, there remain a courtyard with flanking towers and a fine
  Norman gateway. At Coity, about 2 m. distant, there are more extensive
  ruins of its castle, originally the seat of the Turbervilles, lords of
  Coity, but now belonging to the earls of Dunraven. Coity church, dating
  from the 14th century, is a fine cruciform building with central
  embattled tower in Early Decorated style.</p>
