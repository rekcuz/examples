   <title>BRISSAC, DUKES OF.</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRISSAC, DUKES OF.--> The fief of Brissac in Anjou was acquired at
  the end of the 15th century by a noble French family named Cossé
  belonging to the same province. René de Cossé married into the Gouffier
  family, just then very powerful at court, and became <i>premier
  panelier</i> (chief pantler) to Louis XII. Two of his sons were marshals
  of France. Brissac was made a countship in 1560 for Charles, the eldest,
  who was grandmaster of artillery, and governor of Piedmont and of
  Picardy. The second, Artus, who held the offices of <i>grand panetier</i>
  of France and superintendent of finance, distinguished himself in the
  religious wars. Charles II. de Cossé fought for the League, and as
  governor of Paris opened the gates of that town to Henry IV., who created
  him marshal of France in 1594. Brissac was raised to a duchy in the
  peerage of France in 1611. Louis Hercule Timoléon de Cossé, due de
  Brissac, and commandant of the constitutional guard of Louis XVI., was
  killed at Versailles on the 9th of September 1792 for his devotion to the
  king.</p>
