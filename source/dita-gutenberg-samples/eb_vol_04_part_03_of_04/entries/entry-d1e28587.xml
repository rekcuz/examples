   <title>BUBASTIS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUBASTIS,--> the Graecized name of the Egyptian goddess Ubasti,
  meaning "she of [the city] Bast" (B;s-t), a city better known by its
  later name, P-ubasti, "place of Ubasti"; thus the goddess derived her
  name Ubasti from her city (Bast), and in turn the city derived its name
  P-ubasti from that of the goddess; the Greeks, confusing the name of the
  city with that of the goddess, called the latter Bubastis, and the former
  also Bubastis (later Bubastos). Bubastis, capital of the 19th nome of
  Lower Egypt, is now represented by a great mound of ruins called Tell
  Basta, near Zagazig, including the site of a large temple (described by
  Herodotus) strewn with blocks of granite. The monuments discovered there,
  although only those in hard stone have survived, are more important than
  at any other site in the Delta except Tanis and cover a wider range,
  commencing with Khufu (Cheops) and continuing to the thirtieth
  dynasty.</p>
      <p>Ubasti was one of many feline goddesses, figured with the head of a
  lioness. In the great development of reverence for sacred animals which
  took place after the New Kingdom, the domestic cat was especially the
  animal of Bubastis, although it had also to serve for all the other
  feline goddesses, owing no doubt to the scarcity and intractability of
  its congeners. Her hieratic and most general form was still
  lioness-headed, but a popular form, especially in bronze, was a
  cat-headed women, often holding in her right hand a lion aegis, i.e. a
  broad semicircular pectoral surmounted by the head of a lioness, and on
  the left arm a basket. The cat cemetery on the west side of the town
  consisted of numbers of large brick chambers, crammed with burnt and
  decayed mummies, many of which had been enclosed in cat-shaped cases of
  wood and bronze. Herodotus describes the festival of Bubastis, which was
  attended by thousands from all parts of Egypt and was a very riotous
  affair; it has its modern equivalent in the Moslem festival of the sheikh
  Said el Badawi at Tanta. The tablet of Canopus shows that there were two
  festivals of Bubastis, the great and the lesser: perhaps the lesser
  festival was held at Memphis, where the quarter called Ankhto contained a
  temple to this goddess. Her name is found on monuments from the third
  dynasty onwards, but a great stimulus was given to her worship by the
  twenty-second (Bubastite) dynasty and generally by the increased
  importance of Lower Egypt in later times. Her character seems to have
  been essentially mild and playful, in contrast to Sokhmi and other feline
  goddesses. The Greeks equated Ubasti with their Artemis, confusing her
  with the leonine Tafne, sister of Shöou (Apollo). The Egyptians
  themselves delighted in identifying together goddesses of the most
  diverse forms and attributes; but Ubasti was almost indistinguishable in
  form from Tafne. The name of her son Iphthimis (Nfr-tm), pronounced
  Eftem, may mean "All-good," and, in the absence of other information
  about him, suggests a reason why he was identified with Prometheus.</p>
