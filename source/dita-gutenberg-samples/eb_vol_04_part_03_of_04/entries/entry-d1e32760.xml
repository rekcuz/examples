   <title>BUDE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUDE,--> a small seaport and watering-place in the Launceston
  parliamentary division of Cornwall, England, on the north coast at the
  mouth of the river Bude. With the market town of Stratton, 1Â½ m. inland
  to the east, it forms the urban district of Stratton and Bude, with a
  population (1901) of 2308. Bude is served by a branch of the London &amp;
  South-Western railway. Its only notable building is the Early English
  parish church of St Michael and All Angels. The climate is healthy and
  the coast scenery in the neighbourhood fine, especially towards the
  south. There the gigantic cliffs, with their banded strata, have been
  broken into fantastic forms by the waves. Many ships have been wrecked on
  the jagged reefs which fringe their base. The figure-head of one of
  these, the "Bencellon," lost in 1862, is preserved in the churchyard. The
  harbour, sheltered by a breakwater, will admit vessels of 300 tons at
  high water; and the river has been dammed to form a basin for the canal
  which runs to Launceston. Some fishing is carried on: but the staple
  trade is the export of sand, which, being highly charged with carbonate
  of lime, is much used for manure. There are golf links near the town. The
  currents in the bay make bathing dangerous.</p>
