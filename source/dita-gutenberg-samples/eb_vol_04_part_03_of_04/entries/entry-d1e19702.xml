      <p><!--BROADSTAIRS,--> a watering-place, in the Isle of Thanet
  parliamentary division of Kent, England, 3 m. S.E. of Margate, on the
  South-Eastern &amp; Chatham railway. Pop. of urban district, Broadstairs
  and St Peter's (1901) 6466. From 1837 to 1851 Broadstairs was a favourite
  summer resort of Charles Dickens, who, in a sketch called "Our English
  Watering-Place," described it as a place "left high and dry by the tide
  of years." This seaside village, with its "semicircular sweep of houses,"
  grew into a considerable town owing to the influx of summer visitors, for
  whose entertainment there are, besides the "Albion" mentioned by Dickens,
  numerous hotels and boarding-houses, libraries, a bathing establishment
  and a fine promenade. Dickens' residence was called Fort House, but it
  became known as Bleak House, through association with his novel of that
  name, though this was written after his last visit to Broadstairs in
  1851. Broadstairs has a small pier for fishing-boats, first built in the
  reign of Henry VIII. An archway leading down to the shore bears an
  inscription showing that it was erected by George Culmer in 1540, and not
  far off is the site of a chapel of the Virgin, to which ships were
  accustomed to lower their top-sails as they passed. St Peter's parish,
  lying on the landward side of Broadstairs, and included in the urban
  district, has a church dating from the 12th to the end of the 16th
  century. Kingsgate, on the North Foreland, north of Broadstairs on the
  coast, changed its name from St Bartholomew's Gate in honour of Charles
  II.'s landing here with the duke of York in 1683 on his way from London
  to Dover. Stonehouse, close by, now a preparatory school for boys, was
  the residence of Archbishop Tait, whose wife established the orphanage
  here.</p>
