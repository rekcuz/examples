      <p><!--BRIE--> (<i>Briegus saltus</i>, from Celtic <i>briek</i>, clay),
  an agricultural district of northern France, to the E. of Paris, bounded
  W. and S. by the Seine, N. by the Marne. It has an area of 2400 sq. m.,
  comprising the greater part of the department of Seine-et-Marne, together
  with portions of the departments of Seine, Seine-et-Oise, Aisne, Marne
  and Aube. The western portion was known as the <i>Brie française</i>, the
  eastern portion as the <i>Brie champenoise</i>. The Brie forms a plateau
  with few eminences, varying in altitude between 300 and 500 ft. in the
  west, and between 500 and 650 ft. in the east. Its scenery is varied by
  forests of some size—the chief being the Forêt de Senart, the Forêt
  de Crécy and the Forêt d'Armainvilliers. The surface soil is clay in
  which are embedded fragments of siliceous sandstone, used for millstones
  and constructional purposes; the subsoil is limestone. The Yères, a
  tributary of the Seine, and the Grand Morin and Petit Morin, tributaries
  of the Marne, are the chief rivers, but the region is not abundantly
  watered and the rainfall is only between 20 and 24 in. The Brie is famous
  for its grain and its dairy products, especially cheeses.</p>
