      <p><!--BRIOUDE,--> a town of central France, capital of an arrondissement
  in the department of Haute-Loire, on the left bank of the Allier, 1467
  ft. above the sea, 47 m. N.W. of Le Puy on the Paris-Lyon railway. Pop.
  (1906) 4581. Brioude has to a great extent escaped modernization and
  still has many old houses and fountains. Its streets are narrow and
  irregular, but the town is surrounded by wide boulevards lined with
  trees. The only building of consequence is the church of St Julian (12th
  and 13th centuries) in the Romanesque style of Auvergne, of which the
  choir, with its apse and radiating chapels and the mosaic ornamentation
  of the exterior, is a fine example. Brioude is the seat of a sub-prefect,
  and of tribunals of first instance and of commerce. The plain in which it
  is situated is of great fertility; the grain trade of the town is
  considerable, and market-gardening is carried on in the outskirts. The
  industries include brewing, saw-milling, lace-making and antimony mining
  and founding.</p>
      <p>Brioude, the ancient <i>Brinas</i>, was formerly a place of
  considerable importance. It was in turn besieged and captured by the
  Goths (532), the Burgundians, the Saracens (732) and the Normans. In 1181
  the viscount of Polignac, who had sacked the town two years previously,
  made public apology in front of the church, and established a body of
  twenty-five knights to defend the relics of St Julian. For some time
  after 1361 the town was the headquarters of BÃ©renger, lord of Castelnau,
  who was at the head of one of the bands of military adventurers which
  then devastated France. The knights (or canons, as they afterwards
  became) of St Julian bore the title of counts of Brioude, and for a long
  time opposed themselves to the civic liberties of the inhabitants.</p>
