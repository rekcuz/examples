   <title>BUCOLICS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCOLICS--> (from the Gr. <ph outputclass="grk">βουκολικός</ph>,
  "pertaining to a herdsman"), a term occasionally used for rural or
  pastoral poetry. The expression has been traced back in English to the
  beginning of the 14th century, being used to describe the "Eclogues" of
  Virgil. The most celebrated collection of bucolics in antiquity is that
  of Theocritus, of which about thirty, in the Doric dialect, and mainly
  written in hexameter verse, have been preserved. This was the name, as is
  believed, originally given by Virgil to his pastoral poems, with the
  direct object of challenging comparison with the writings of Theocritus.
  In modern times the term "bucolics" has not often been specifically given
  by the poets to their pastorals; the main exception being that of
  Ronsard, who collected his eclogues under the title of "Les Bucoliques."
  In general practice the word is almost a synonym for pastoral poetry, but
  has come to bear a slightly more agricultural than shepherd
  signification, so that the "Georgics" of Virgil has grown to seem almost
  more "bucolic" than his "Eclogues." (See also <ph outputclass="sc">Pastoral</ph>.)</p>
