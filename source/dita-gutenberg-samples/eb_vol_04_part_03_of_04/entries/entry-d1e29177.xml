   <title>BUCHAN, ELSPETH</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCHAN, ELSPETH--> (1738-1791), founder of a Scottish religious
  sect known as the Buchanites, was the daughter of John Simpson,
  proprietor of an inn near Banff. Having quarrelled with her husband,
  Robert Buchan, a potter of Greenock, she settled with her children in
  Glasgow, where she was deeply impressed by a sermon preached by Hugh
  White, minister of the Relief church at Irvine. She persuaded White and
  others that she was a saint with a special mission, that in fact she was
  the woman, and White the man-child, described in Revelation xii. White
  was condemned by the presbytery, and the sect, which ultimately numbered
  forty-six adherents, was expelled by the magistrates in 1784 and settled
  in a farm, consisting of one room and a loft, known as New Cample in
  Dumfriesshire. Mrs Buchan claimed prophetic inspiration and pretended to
  confer the Holy Ghost upon her followers by breathing upon them; they
  believed that the millennium was near, and that they would not die, but
  be translated. It appears that they had community of wives and lived on
  funds provided by the richer members. Robert Burns, the poet, in a letter
  dated August 1784, describes the sect as idle and immoral. In 1785 White
  and Mrs Buchan published a <i>Divine Dictionary</i>, but the sect broke
  up on the death of its founder in spite of White's attempts to prove that
  she was only in a trance. Even White was eventually undeceived. Andrew
  Innes, the last survivor, died in 1848. See J. Train, <i>The Buchanites
  from First to Last</i> (Edinburgh, 1846).</p>
