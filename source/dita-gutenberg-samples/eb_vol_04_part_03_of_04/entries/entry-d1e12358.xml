   <body>
      <p><!--BRIGHTLINGSEA--> (pronounced <ph outputclass="sc">Brittlesea</ph>),
  a port and fishing station in the Harwich parliamentary division of
  Essex, England, on a creek opening from the east shore of the Colne
  estuary, the terminus of a branch from Colchester of the Great Eastern
  railway, 62Â½ m. E.N.E. of London. Pop. of urban district (1901) 4501. The
  Colchester oyster beds are mainly in this part of the Colne, and the
  oyster fishery is the chief industry. Boat-building is carried on. This
  is also a favourite yachting centre. The church of All Saints,
  principally Perpendicular, has interesting monuments and brasses, and a
  fine lofty tower and west front. Brightlingsea, which appears in
  Domesday, is a member of the Cinque Port of Sandwich in Kent. Near the
  opposite shore of the creek is St Osyth's priory, which originated as a
  nunnery founded by Osyth, a grand-daughter of Penda, king of Mercia,
  martyred (<i>c.</i> 653) by Norse invaders. A foundation for Augustinian
  canons followed on the site early in the 12th century. The remains,
  incorporated with a modern residence, include a late Perpendicular
  gateway, abbots' tower, clock tower and crypt. The gateway, an embattled
  structure with flanking turrets, is particularly fine, the entire front
  being panelled and ornamented with canopied niches. The church of St
  Osyth, also Perpendicular in the main, is of interest.</p>
