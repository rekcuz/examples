   <title>BROMELIACEAE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BROMELIACEAE-->, in botany, a natural order of Monocotyledons,
  confined to tropical and sub-tropical America. It includes the pine-apple
  (fig. 1) and the so-called Spanish moss (fig. 2), a rootless plant, which
  hangs in long grey lichen-like festoons from the branches of trees, a
  native of Mexico and the southern United States; the water required for
  food is absorbed from the moisture in the air by peculiar hairs which
  cover the surface of the shoots. The plants are generally herbs with a
  much shortened stem bearing a rosette of leaves and a spike or panicle of
  flowers. They are eminently dry-country plants (xerophytes); the narrow
  leaves are protected from loss of water by a thick cuticle, and have a
  well-developed sheath which embraces the stem and forms, with the sheaths
  of the other leaves of the rosette, a basin in which water collects, with
  fragments of rotting leaves and the like. Peculiar hairs are developed on
  the inner surface of the sheath by which the water and dissolved
  substances are absorbed, thus helping to feed the plant. The leaf-margins
  are often spiny, and the leaf-spines of <i>Puya chilensis</i> are used by
  the natives as fish-hooks. Several species are grown as hot-house plants
  for the bright colour of their flowers or flower-bracts, e.g. species of
  <i>Tillandsia</i>, <i>Billbergia</i>, <i>Aechmea</i> and others.</p>
