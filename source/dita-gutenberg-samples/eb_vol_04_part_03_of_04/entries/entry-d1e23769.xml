   <body>
      <p><!--BROWN, WILLIAM LAURENCE--> (1755-1830), Scottish divine, was born
  on the 7th of January 1755 at Utrecht, where his father was minister of
  the English church. The father, having been appointed professor of
  ecclesiastical history at St Andrews, returned to Scotland in 1757, and
  his son went to the grammar school of that city, and then to the
  university. After passing through the divinity classes, he went in 1774
  to the university of Utrecht, where he studied theology and civil law. In
  1777 he was appointed to the English church in Utrecht, and about 1788 to
  the professorship of moral philosophy and ecclesiastical history in the
  university, to which was soon added the professorship of the law of
  nature. The war which followed the French Revolution finally drove Brown
  in January 1795 to London, where he was cordially welcomed. In 1795 the
  magistrates of Aberdeen appointed him to the chair of divinity, and soon
  after he was made principal of Marischal College. In the year 1800 he was
  appointed chaplain in ordinary to the king, and in 1804 dean of the
  chapel royal, and of the order of the Thistle. He died on the 11th of May
  1830. His most widely-known works were an <i>Essay on the Natural
  Equality of Men</i> (1793), which gained the Teyler Society's prize; a
  treatise <i>On the Existence of the Supreme Creator</i> (1816), to which
  was awarded the first Burnet prize of Â£1250; and <i>A Comparative View of
  Christianity, and of the other Forms of Religion with regard to their
  Moral Tendency</i> (2 vols., 1826).</p>
