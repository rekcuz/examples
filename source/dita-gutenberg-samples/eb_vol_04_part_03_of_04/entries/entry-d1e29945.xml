   <title>BÜCKEBURG</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BÜCKEBURG,--> a town of Germany, capital of the principality of
  Schaumburg-Lippe, pleasantly situated at the foot of the Harrelberg on
  the river Aue, 6 m. from Minden, on the main railway from Cologne to
  Berlin. Pop. 6000. It has a palace standing in extensive grounds, a
  gymnasium, a normal seminary, a library, a synagogue, and three churches,
  one of which has the appropriate inscription, <i>Religionis non
  structurae exemplum</i>. The first houses of Bückeburg began to gather
  round the castle about 1365; and it was not till the 17th century that
  the town was surrounded with walls, which have given place to a ring of
  pretty promenades. The poet J.G. von Herder was court preacher here from
  1771 to 1776.</p>
