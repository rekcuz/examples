   <title>BULAWAYO</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BULAWAYO,--> the capital of Matabeleland, the western province of
  southern Rhodesia, South Africa. White population (1904) 3840. It
  occupies a central position on the tableland between the Limpopo and
  Zambezi rivers, is 4469 ft. above the sea and 1362 m. north-east of Cape
  Town by rail. Beira, the nearest port, is 398 m. east in a direct line,
  but distant 675 m. by railway. Another railway, part of the Cape to Cairo
  connexion, runs north-west from Bulawayo, crossing the Zambezi just below
  the Victoria Falls. In the centre of the town is a large market square to
  which roads lead in regular lines north, south, east and <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page772">[v.04 p.0772]</ph>west.
  Those going east and west are called avenues and are numbered, those
  running north and south are called streets and are named. Through the
  centre of Market Square runs Rhodes Street. There are many handsome
  public and private buildings. In front of the stock exchange is a
  monument in memory of the 257 settlers killed in the Matabele rebellion
  of 1896, and at the junction of two of the principal streets is a
  colossal bronze statue of Cecil Rhodes. East of the town is a large park
  and botanical gardens, beyond which is a residential suburb. The railway
  station and water and electric supply works are in the south-west
  quarter. An avenue 130 ft. broad and nearly 1Â½ m. long, planted
  throughout its length with trees, leads from the town to Government
  House, which is built on the site of Lobengula's royal kraal. The tree
  under which that chieftain sat when giving judgment has been preserved. A
  number of gold reefs intersect the surrounding district and in some of
  the reefs gold is mined. South-south-east of the town are the Matoppo
  Hills. In a grave in one of these hills, 33 m. from Bulawayo, Rhodes is
  buried.</p>
      <p>The "Place of Slaughter," as the Zulu word Bulawayo is interpreted,
  was founded about 1838 by Lobengula's father, Mosilikatze, some distance
  south of the present town, and continued to be the royal residence till
  its occupation by the British South Africa Company's forces in November
  1893, when a new town was founded. Four years later the railway
  connecting it with Cape Town was completed (see <ph outputclass="sc">Rhodesia</ph>).</p>
