   <title>BUDAPEST</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUDAPEST,--> the capital and largest town of the kingdom of
  Hungary, and the second town of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, 163 m.
  S.E. of Vienna by rail. Budapest is situated on both banks of the Danube,
  and is formed of the former towns of Buda (Ger. <i>Ofen</i>) together
  with O-Buda (Ger. <i>Alt-Ofen</i>) on the right bank, and of Pest
  together with Köbánya (Ger. <i>Steinbruch</i>) on the left bank, which
  were all incorporated into one municipality in 1872. It lies at a point
  where the Danube has definitely taken its southward course, and just
  where the outlying spurs of the outer ramifications of the Alps, namely,
  the Bakony Mountains, meet the Carpathians. Budapest is situated nearly
  in the centre of Hungary, and dominates by its strategical position the
  approach from the west to the great Hungarian plain. The imposing size of
  the Danube, 300 to 650 yds. broad, and the sharp contrast of the two
  banks, place Budapest among the most finely situated of the larger towns
  of Europe. On the one side is a flat sandy plain, in which lies Pest,
  modern of aspect regularly laid out, and presenting a long frontage of
  handsome buildings to the river. On the other the ancient town of Buda
  straggles capriciously over a series of small and steep hills, commanded
  by the fortress and the Blocksberg (770 ft. high, 390 ft. above the
  Danube), and backed beyond by spurs of mountains, which rise in the form
  of terraces one above the other. The hills are generally devoid of
  forests, while those near the towns were formerly covered with vineyards,
  which produced a good red wine. The vineyards have been almost completely
  destroyed by the phylloxera.</p>
      <p>Budapest covers an area of 78 sq. m., and is divided into ten
  municipal districts, namely Vár (Festung), Viziváros (Wasserstadt),
  Ó-Buda (Alt-Ofen), all on the right bank, belonging to Buda, and Belváros
  (Inner City), Lipótváros (Leopoldstadt), Terézváros (Theresienstadt),
  Erzsébetváros (Elisabethstadt), Józsefváros (Josephstadt), Ferenczváros
  (Franzstadt), and Köbánya (Steinbruch), all on the left bank, belonging
  to Pest. Buda, with its royal palace, the various ministries, and other
  government offices, is the official centre, while Pest is the commercial
  and industrial part, as well as the centre of the nationalistic and
  intellectual life of the town. The two banks of the Danube are united by
  six bridges, including two fine suspension bridges; the first of them,
  generally known as the Ketten-Brücke, constructed by the brothers Tiernay
  and Adam Clark in 1842-1849, is one of the largest in Europe. It is 410
  yds. long, 39 ft. broad, 36 ft. high above the mean level of the water,
  and its chains rest on two pillars 160 ft. high; its ends are ornamented
  with four colossal stone lions. At one end is a tunnel, 383 yds. long,
  constructed by Adam Clark in 1854, which pierces the castle hill and
  connects the quarter known as the Christinenstadt with the Danube. The
  other suspension bridge is the Schwurplatz bridge, completed in 1903, 56
  ft. broad, with a span of 317 yds. The other bridges are the Margaret
  bridge, with a junction bridge towards the Margaret island, the Franz
  Joseph bridge, and two railway bridges.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most attractive part of Budapest is the line of broad
  quays on the left bank of the Danube, which extend for a distance of 2½
  m. from the Margaret bridge to the custom-house, and are lined with
  imposing buildings. The most important of these is the Franz Joseph Quai,
  1 m. long, which contains the most fashionable cafés and hotels, and is
  the favourite promenade. The inner town is surrounded by the Innere
  Ring-Strasse, a circle of wide boulevards on the site of the old wall.
  Wide tree-shaded streets, like the Király Utcza, the Kerrepesi Ut, and
  the Üllöi Ut, also form the lines of demarcation between the different
  districts. The inner ring is connected by the Váczi Körut (Waitzner-Ring)
  with the Grosse Ring-Strasse, a succession of boulevards, describing a
  semicircle beginning at the Margaret bridge and ending at the Boráros
  Platz, near the custom-house quay, through about the middle of the town.
  One of the most beautiful streets in the town is the Andrássy Ut, 1½ m.
  long, connecting Váczi Körut with Városliget (<i>Stadtwäldchen</i>), the
  favourite public park of Budapest. It is a busy thoroughfare, lined in
  its first half with magnificent new buildings, and in its second half,
  where it attains a width of 150 ft., with handsome villas standing in
  their own gardens, which give the impression rather of a fashionable
  summer resort than the centre of a great city. Budapest possesses
  numerous squares, generally ornamented with monuments of prominent
  Hungarians, usually the work of Hungarian artists.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Buildings.</i>—Though of ancient origin, neither Buda nor
  Pest has much to show in the way of venerable buildings. The oldest
  church is the Matthias church in Buda, begun by King Bela IV. in the 13th
  century, completed in the 15th century, and restored in 1890-1896. It was
  used as a mosque during the Turkish occupation, and here took place the
  coronation of Franz Joseph as king of Hungary in 1867. The garrison
  church, a Gothic building of the 13th century, and the Reformed church,
  finished in 1898, are the other ecclesiastical buildings in Buda worth
  mentioning. The oldest church in Pest is the parish church situated in
  the Eskü-Ter (Schwur-Platz) in the inner town; it was built in 1500, in
  the Gothic style, and restored in 1890. The most magnificent church in
  Pest is the Leopoldstadt Basilica, a Romanesque building with a dome 315
  ft. in height, begun in 1851; next comes the Franzstadt church, also a
  Romanesque building, erected in 1874. Besides several modern churches,
  Budapest possesses a beautiful synagogue, in the Moorish style, erected
  in 1861, and another, in the Moorish-Byzantine style, built in 1872,
  while in 1901 the construction of a much larger synagogue was begun. In
  Buda, near the Kaiserbad, and not far from the Margaret bridge, is a
  small octagonal Turkish mosque, with a dome 25 ft. high, beneath which is
  the grave of a Turkish monk. By a special article in the treaty of
  Karlowitz of 1699 the emperor of Austria undertook to preserve this
  monument.</p>
      <p>Among the secular buildings the first place is taken by the royal
  palace in Buda, which, together with the old fortress, crowns the summit
  of a hill, and forms the nucleus of the town. The palace erected by Maria
  Theresa in 1748-1771 was partly burned in 1849, but has been restored and
  largely extended since 1894. In the court chapel are preserved the
  regalia of Hungary, namely, the crown of St Stephen, the sceptre, orb,
  sword and the coronation robes. It is surrounded by a magnificent garden,
  which descends in steep terraces to the Danube, and which offers a
  splendid view of the town lying on the opposite bank. New and palatial
  buildings of the various ministries, several high and middle schools, a
  few big hospitals, and the residences of several Hungarian magnates, are
  among the principal edifices in this part of the town.</p>
      <p>The long range of substantial buildings fronting the left bank of the
  Danube includes the Houses of Parliament (see <ph outputclass="sc">Architecture</ph>, Plate IX. fig. 115), a huge limestone
  edifice in the late Gothic style, covering an area of 3¾ acres, erected
  in 1883-1902; the Academy, in Renaissance style, erected in 1862-1864,
  containing a lofty reception room, a library, a historic picture gallery,
  and a botanic collection; the Redoute buildings, a large structure in a
  mixed Romanesque and Moorish style, erected for balls and other social
  purposes; the extensive custom-house at the lower end of the quays, and
  several fine hotels and insurance offices. In the beautiful Andrássy Ut
  are the opera-house (1875-1884), in the Italian Renaissance style; the
  academy of music; the old and new exhibition building; the national
  drawing school; and the museum of fine arts (1900-1905), in which was
  installed in 1905 the national gallery, formed by Prince Esterházy,
  bought by the government in 1865 for £130,000, and formerly housed in the
  academy, and the collection of modern pictures from the national museum.
  At the end of the street is one of the numerous monuments erected in
  various parts of the country to commemorate the thousandth anniversary of
  the foundation of the kingdom of Hungary. Other buildings remarkable for
  their <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page735">[v.04
  p.0735]</ph>size and interest are: the national museum (1836-1844); the
  town-hall (1869-1875), in the early Renaissance style; the university,
  with a baroque façade (rebuilt 1900), and the university library (opened
  in 1875), a handsome Renaissance building; the palace of justice (1896),
  a magnificent edifice situated not far from the Houses of Parliament. In
  its neighbourhood also are the palatial buildings of the ministries of
  justice and of agriculture. There are also the exchange (1905); the
  Austro-Hungarian bank (1904); the central post and telegraph office; the
  art-industrial museum (1893-1897), in oriental style, with some
  characteristically Hungarian ornamentations; several handsome theatres;
  large barracks; technical and secondary schools; two great railway
  termini and a central market (1897) to be mentioned. To the south-east of
  the town lies the vast slaughter-house (1870-1872), which, with the
  adjacent cattle-market, covers nearly 30 acres of ground. The building
  activity of Budapest since 1867 has been extraordinary, and the town has
  undergone a thorough transformation. The removal of slums and the
  regulation of the older parts of the town, in connexion with the
  construction of the two new bridges across the Danube and of the railway
  termini, went hand-in-hand with the extension of the town, new quarters
  springing up on both banks of the Danube. This process is still going on,
  and Budapest has become one of the handsomest capitals of Europe.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Education.</i>—Budapest is the intellectual capital of
  Hungary. At the head of its educational institutions stands the
  university, which was attended in 1900 by 4983 students—only about
  2000 in 1880—and has a staff of nearly 200 professors and
  lecturers. It has been completely transformed into a national Hungarian
  seat of learning since 1867, and great efforts have been made to keep at
  home the Hungarian students, who before then frequented other
  universities and specially that of Vienna. It is well provided with
  scientific laboratories, botanic garden, and various collections, and
  possesses a library with nearly a quarter of a million volumes. The
  university of Budapest, the only one in Hungary proper, was established
  at Tyrnau in 1635, removed to Buda in 1777, and transferred to Pest in
  1783. Next to it comes the polytechnic, attended by 1816 students in
  1900, which is also thoroughly equipped for a scientific training. Other
  high schools are a veterinary academy, a Roman Catholic seminary, a
  Protestant theological college, a rabbinical institute, a commercial
  academy, to which has been added in 1899 an academy for the study of
  oriental languages, and military academies for the training of Hungarian
  officers. Budapest possesses an adequate number of elementary and
  secondary schools, as well as a great number of special and technical
  schools. At the head of the scientific societies stands the academy of
  sciences, founded in 1825, for the encouragement of the study of the
  Hungarian language and the various sciences except theology. Next to it
  comes the national museum, founded in 1807 through the donations of Count
  Stephan Széchényi, which contains extensive collections of antiquities,
  natural history and ethnology, and a rich library which, in its
  manuscript department of over 20,000 MSS., contains the oldest specimens
  of the Hungarian language. Another society which has done great service
  for the cultivation of the Hungarian language is the Kisfaludy society,
  founded in 1836. It began by distributing prizes for the best literary
  productions of the year, then it started the collection and publication
  of the Hungarian folklore, and lastly undertook the translation into the
  Hungarian language of the masterpieces of foreign literatures. The
  influence exercised by this society is very great, and it has attracted
  within its circle the best writers of Hungary. Another society similar in
  aim with this one is the Petöfi society, founded in 1875. Amongst the
  numerous scientific associations are the central statistical department,
  and the Budapest communal bureau of statistics, which under the
  directorship of Dr Joseph de Körösy has gained a European reputation.</p>
      <p>The artistic life in Budapest is fostered by the academy of music,
  which once had Franz Liszt as its director, a <i>conservatoire</i> of
  music, a dramatic school, and a school for painting and for drawing, all
  maintained by the government. Budapest possesses, besides an opera house,
  eight theatres, of which two are subsidized by the government and one by
  the municipality. The performances are almost exclusively in Hungarian,
  the exceptions being the occasional appearance of French, Italian and
  other foreign artists. Performances in German are under a popular taboo,
  and they are never given in a theatre at Budapest.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Trade.</i>—-In commerce and industry Budapest is by far the
  most important town in Hungary, and in the former, if not also in the
  latter, it is second to Vienna alone in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.
  The principal industries are steam flour-milling, distilling, and the
  manufacture of machinery, railway plant, carriages, cutlery, gold and
  silver wares, chemicals, bricks, jute, and the usual articles produced in
  large towns for home consumption. The trade of Budapest is mainly in
  corn, flour, cattle, horses, pigs, wines, spirits, wool, wood, hides, and
  in the articles manufactured in the town. The efforts of the Hungarian
  government to establish a great home industry, and the measures taken to
  that effect, have benefited Budapest to a greater degree than any other
  Hungarian town, and the progress made is remarkable. The increase in the
  number of joint-stock companies, and the capital thus invested in
  industrial undertakings, furnish a valuable indication. In 1873 there
  were 28 such companies with a total capital of £2,224,900; in 1890, 75
  with a capital of £9,352,000; and in 1899 no fewer than 242 with a total
  capital of £31,378,655. Budapest owes its great commercial importance to
  its situation on the Danube, on which the greater part of its trade is
  carried. The introduction of steamboats on the Danube in 1830 was one of
  the earliest material causes of the progress of Budapest, and gave a
  great stimulus to its corn trade. This still continues to operate, having
  been promoted by the flour-milling industry, which was revolutionized by
  certain local inventions. Budapest is actually one of the greatest
  milling centres in the world, possessing a number of magnificent
  establishments, fitted with machinery invented and manufactured in the
  city. Budapest is, besides, connected with all the principal places in
  Austria and Hungary by a well-developed net of railways, which all
  radiate from here.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Population.</i>—Few European towns grew so rapidly as
  Budapest generally, and Pest particularly, during the 19th century, and
  probably none has witnessed such a thorough transformation since 1867. In
  1799 the joint population of Buda and Pest was 54,179, of which 24,306
  belonged to Buda, and 29,870 belonged to Pest, being the first time that
  the population of Pest exceeded that of Buda. By 1840, however, Buda had
  added but 14,000 to its population while that of Pest had more than
  doubled; and of the joint population of 270,685 in 1869, fully 200,000
  fell to the share of Pest. In 1880 the civil population of Budapest was
  360,551, an increase since 1869 of 32%; and in 1890 it was 491,938, and
  increase of 36.57% in the decade. In the matter of the increase of its
  population alone, Budapest has only been slightly surpassed by one
  European town, namely, Berlin. Both capitals multiplied their population
  by nine in the first nine decades of the century. According to an
  interesting and instructive comparison of the growth of twenty-eight
  European cities made by Dr Joseph de Körösy, Berlin in 1890 showed an
  increase, as compared with the beginning of the century, of 818% and
  Budapest of 809%. Within the same period the increase of Paris was 343%,
  and of London 340%. In 1900 the civil population of Budapest was 716,476
  inhabitants, showing an increase of 44.82% in the decade. To this must be
  added a garrison of 15,846 men, making a total population 732,322. Of the
  total population, civil and military, 578,458 were Magyars, 104,520 were
  Germans, 25,168 were Slovaks, and the remainder was composed of
  Croatians, Servians, Rumanians, Russians, Greeks, Armenians, Gypsies,
  &amp;c. According to religion, there were 445,023 Roman Catholics, 5806
  Greek Catholics, 4422 Greek Orthodox; 67,319 were Protestants of the
  Helvetic, and 38,811 were Protestants of the Augsburg Confessions;
  168,985 were Jews, and the remainder belonged to various other creeds. A
  striking feature in the progress of Budapest is the decline in the
  death-rate, which sank from 43.4 per thousand in 1874 to 20.6 per
  thousand in 1900. In addition to the increased influx of <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page736">[v.04
  p.0736]</ph>persons in the prime of life, this is due largely to the
  improved water-supply and better sanitary conditions generally, including
  increased hospital accommodation.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Social Position.</i>—Budapest is the seat of the government
  of Hungary, of the parliament, and of all the highest official
  authorities—civil, military, judicial and financial. It is the
  meeting-place, alternately with Vienna, of the Austro-Hungarian
  delegations, and it was elected to an equality with Vienna as a royal
  residence in 1892. It is the see of a Roman Catholic archbishop. The town
  is administered by an elected municipal council, which consists of 400
  members. As Paris is sometimes said to be France, so may Budapest with
  almost greater truth be said to be Hungary. Its composite population is a
  faithful reflection of the heterogeneous elements in the dominions of the
  Habsburgs, while the trade and industry of Hungary are centralized at
  Budapest in a way that can scarcely be affirmed of any other European
  capital. In virtue of its cultural institutions, it is also the
  intellectual and artistic centre of Hungary. The movement in favour of
  Magyarizing all institutions has found its strongest development in
  Budapest, where the German names have all been removed from the buildings
  and streets. The wonderful progress of Budapest is undoubtedly due to the
  revival of the Hungarian national spirit in the first half of the 19th
  century, and to the energetic and systematic efforts of the government
  and people of Hungary since the restoration of the constitution. So far
  as Hungary was concerned, Budapest in 1867 at once became the favoured
  rival of Vienna, with the important additional advantage that it had no
  such competitors within its own sphere as Vienna had in the Austrian
  provincial capitals. The political, intellectual, and social life of
  Hungary was centred in Budapest, and had largely been so since 1848, when
  it became the seat of the legislature, as it was that of the Austrian
  central administration which followed the revolution. The ideal of a
  prosperous, brilliant and attractive Magyar capital, which would keep the
  nobles and the intellectual flower of the country at home, uniting them
  in the service of the Fatherland, had received a powerful impetus from
  Count Stephan Széchényi, the great Hungarian reformer of the
  pre-Revolutionary period. His work, continued by patriotic and able
  successors, was now taken up as the common task of the government and the
  nation. Thus the promotion of the interests of the capital and the
  centralization of the public and commercial life of the country have
  formed an integral part of the policy of the state since the restoration
  of the constitution. Budapest has profited largely by the encouragement
  of agriculture, trade and industry, by the nationalization of the
  railways, by the development of inland navigation, and also by the
  neglect of similar measures in favour of Vienna.</p>
      <p>From that time to the present day the record of the Hungarian capital
  has been one of uninterrupted advance, not merely in externals, such as
  the removal of slums, the reconstruction of the town, the development of
  communications, industry and trade, and the erection of important public
  buildings, but also in the mental, moral and physical elevation of the
  inhabitants; besides another important gain from the point of view of the
  Hungarian statesman, namely, the progressive increase and improvement of
  status of the Magyar element of the population. When it is remembered
  that the ideal of both the authorities and the people is the ultimate
  monopoly of the home market by Hungarian industry and trade, and the
  strengthening of the Magyar influence by centralization, it is easy to
  understand the progress of Budapest.</p>
      <p>Politically, this ambitious and progressive capital is the creation of
  the Magyar upper classes. Commercially and industrially, it may be said
  to be the work of the Jews. The sound judgment of the former led them to
  welcome and appreciate the co-operation of the latter. Indeed, a
  readiness to assimilate foreign elements is characteristic of Magyar
  patriotism, which has, particularly within the last generation, made
  numerous converts among the other nationalities of Hungary, and—for
  national purposes—may be considered to have quite absorbed the
  Hungarian Jews. It has thus come to pass that there is no anti-Semitism
  in Budapest, although the Hebrew element is proportionately much larger
  (21% as compared with 9%) than it is in Vienna, the Mecca of the
  Jew-baiter.</p>
      <p>Budapest has long been celebrated for its mineral springs and baths,
  some of them having been already used during the Roman period. They rise
  at the foot of the Blocksberg, and are powerful chalybeate and
  sulphureous hot springs, with a temperature of 80°-150° Fahr. The
  principal baths are the Bruckbad and the Kaiserbad, both dating from the
  Turkish period; the St Lucasbad; and the Raitzenbad, rebuilt in 1860, one
  of the most magnificent establishments of its kind, which was connected
  through a gallery with the royal palace in the time of Matthias Corvin.
  There is an artesian well of sulphureous water with a temperature of 153°
  Fahr. in the Stadtwäldchen; and another, yielding sulphureous water with
  a temperature of 110° Fahr., which is used for both drinking and bathing,
  in the Margaret island. The mineral springs, which yield bitter alkaline
  waters, are situated in the plain south of the Blocksberg, and are over
  40 in number. The principal are the Hunyadi-János spring, of which about
  1,000,000 bottles are exported annually, the Arpad spring, and the Apenta
  spring.</p>
      <p>The largest and most popular of the parks in Budapest is the
  Városliget, on the north-east side of the town. It has an area of 286
  acres, and contains the zoological garden. On an island in its large pond
  are situated the agricultural (1902-1904) and the ethnographical museums.
  It was in this park that the millennium exhibition of 1896 took place. A
  still more delightful resort is the Margaret island, a long narrow island
  in the Danube, the property of the archduke Joseph, which has been laid
  out in the style of an English park, with fine trees, velvety turf and a
  group of villas and bath-houses. The name of the island is derived from
  St Margaret, the daughter of King Bela IV. (13th century), who built here
  a convent, the ruins of which are still in existence. To the west of Buda
  extends the hill (1463 ft.) of Sváb-Hegy (<i>Schwabenberg</i>), with
  extensive view and numerous villas; it is ascended by a rack-and-pinion
  railway. A favourite spot is the Zugliget (<i>Auwinkel</i>), a wooded
  dale on the northern slope of the hill. To the north of Ó-Buda, about 4
  m. from the Margaret island, on the right bank of the Danube, are the
  remains of the Roman colony of Aquincum. They include the foundations of
  an amphitheatre, of a temple, of an aqueduct, of baths and of a castrum.
  The objects found here are preserved in a small museum. To the north of
  Pest lies the historic Rákos field, where the Hungarian diets were held
  in the open air from the 10th to the 14th century; and 23 m. to the north
  lies the royal castle of Gödöllö, with its beautiful park.</p>
      <p>
         <i>History.</i>—The history of Budapest consists of the separate
  history of the two sister towns, Buda and Pest. The Romans founded, in
  the 2nd century <ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph>, on the right bank of the
  Danube, on the site of the actual Ó-Buda, a colony, on the place of a
  former Celtic settlement. This colony was named Aquincum, a
  transformation from the former Celtic name of <i>Ak-ink</i>, meaning
  "rich waters." The Roman occupation lasted till <ph outputclass="scac">A.D.</ph> 376, and then the place was invaded by Huns,
  Ostrogoths, and later by Avars and Slavs. When the Magyars came into the
  country, at the end of the 10th century, they preserved the names of Buda
  and Pest, which they found for these two places. The origin of Pest
  proper is obscure, but the name, apparently derived from the old Slavonic
  <i>pestj</i>, a stove (like Ofen, the German name of Buda), seems to
  point to an early Slavonic settlement. The Romans never gained a foothold
  on this side of the river.</p>
      <p>When it first appears in history Pest was essentially a German
  settlement, and a chronicler of the 13th century describes it as "Villa
  Teutonica ditissima." Christianity was introduced early in the 11th
  century. In 1241 Pest was destroyed by the Tatars, after whose departure
  in 1244 it was created a royal free city by Bela IV., and repeopled with
  colonists of various nationalities. The succeeding period seems to have
  been one of considerable prosperity, though Pest was completely eclipsed
  by the sister town of Buda with its fortress and palace. This fortress
  and palace were built by King Bela IV. in 1247, and were the nucleus
  round which the town of Buda was built, which soon gained <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page737">[v.04 p.0737]</ph>great
  importance, and became in 1361 the capital of Hungary. In 1526 Pest was
  taken and pillaged by the Turks, and from 1541 to 1686 Buda was the seat
  of a Turkish pasha. Pest in the meantime entirely lost its importance,
  and on the departure of the Turks was left little more than a heap of
  ruins. Its favourable situation and the renewal of former privileges
  helped it to revive, and in 1723 it became the seat of the highest
  Hungarian officials. Maria Theresa and Joseph II. did much to increase
  its importance, but the rapid growth which enabled it completely to
  outstrip Buda belongs entirely to the 19th century. A signal proof of its
  vitality was given in 1838 by the speed and ease with which it recovered
  from a disastrous inundation that destroyed 3000 houses. In 1848 Pest
  became the seat of the revolutionary diet, but in the following year the
  insurgents had to retire before the Austrians under Windischgrätz. A
  little later the Austrians had to retire in their turn, leaving a
  garrison in the fortress of Buda, and, while the Hungarians endeavoured
  to capture this position, General Hentzi retaliated by bombarding Pest,
  doing great damage to the town. In 1872 both towns were united into one
  municipality. In 1896 took place here the millennium exhibition, in
  celebration of the thousandth anniversary of the foundation of the
  kingdom of Hungary.</p>
      <p>
         <ph outputclass="sc">Bibliography</ph>.—The official publications
  of the Budapest Communal Bureau of Statistics have acquired a European
  repute for their completeness, and their fearless exposure of
  shortcomings has been an element in the progress of the town. Reference
  should also be made to separate works of the director of that
  institution, Dr Joseph de Körösy, known in England for his discovery of
  the law of marital fertility, published by the Royal Society, and by his
  labours in the development of comparative international statistics. His
  <i>Statistique Internationale des grandes villes</i> and <i>Bulletin
  annuel des finances des grandes villes</i> give valuable comparative
  data. See also <i>Die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie in Wort und
