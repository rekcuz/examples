   <title>BRETSCHNEIDER, KARL GOTTLIEB</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRETSCHNEIDER, KARL GOTTLIEB--> (1776-1848), German scholar and
  theologian, was born at Gersdorf in Saxony. In 1794 he entered the
  university of Leipzig, where he studied theology for four years. After
  some years of hesitation he resolved to be ordained, and in 1802 he
  passed with great distinction the examination for <i>candidatus
  theologiae</i>, and attracted the regard of F.V. Reinhard, author of the
  <i>System der christlichen Moral</i> (1788-1815), then court-preacher at
  Dresden, who became his warm friend and patron during the remainder of
  his life. In 1804-1806 Bretschneider was <i>Privat-docent</i> at the
  university of Wittenberg, where he lectured on philosophy and theology.
  During this time he wrote his work on the development of dogma,
  <i>Systematische Entwickelung aller in der Dogmatik vorkommenden Begriffe
  nach den symbolischen Schriften der evangelisch-lutherischen und
  reformirten Kirche</i> (1805, 4th ed. 1841), which was followed by
  others, including an edition of Ecclesiasticus with a Latin commentary.
  On the advance of the French army under Napoleon into Prussia, he
  determined to leave Wittenberg and abandon his university career. Through
  the good offices of Reinhard, he became pastor of Schneeberg in Saxony
  (1807). In 1808 he was promoted to the office of superintendent of the
  church of Annaberg, in which capacity he had to decide, in accordance
  with the canon law of Saxony, many matters belonging to the department of
  ecclesiastical law. But the climate did not agree with him, and his
  official duties interfered with his theological studies. With a view to a
  change he took the degree of doctor of theology in Wittenberg in August
  1812. In 1816 he was appointed general superintendent at Gotha, where he
  remained until his death in 1848. This was the great period of his
  literary activity.</p>
      <p>In 1820 was published his treatise on the gospel of St John, entitled
  <i>Probabilia de Evangelii el Epistolarum Joannis Apostoli indole et
  origine</i>, which attracted much attention. In it he collected with
  great fulness and discussed with marked moderation the arguments against
  Johannine authorship. This called forth a number of replies. To the
  astonishment of every one, Bretschneider announced in the preface to the
  second edition of his <i>Dogmatik</i> in 1822, that he had never doubted
  the authenticity of the gospel, and had published his <i>Probabilia</i>
  only to draw attention to the subject, and to call forth a more complete
  defence of its genuineness. Bretschneider remarks in his autobiography
  that the publication of this work had the effect of preventing his
  appointment as successor to Karl C. Tittmann in Dresden, the minister
  Detlev von Einsiedel (1773-1861) denouncing him as the "slanderer of
  John" (<i>Johannisschänder</i>). His greatest contribution to the science
  of exegesis was his <i>Lexicon Manuale Graeco-Latinum in libros Novi
  Testamenti</i> (1824, 3rd ed. 1840). This work was valuable for the use
  which its author made of the Greek of the Septuagint, of the Old and New
  Testament Apocrypha, of Josephus, and of the apostolic fathers, in
  illustration of the language of the New Testament. In 1826 he published
  <i>Apologie der neuern Theologie des evangelischen Deutschlands</i>. Hugh
  James Rose had published in England (1825) a volume of sermons on the
  rationalist movement (<i>The State of the Protestant Religion in
  Germany</i>), in which he classed Bretschneider with the rationalists;
  and Bretschneider contended that he himself was not a rationalist in the
  ordinary sense of the term, but a "rational supernaturalist." Some of his
  numerous dogmatic writings passed through several editions. An English
  translation of his <i>Manual of the Religion and History of the Christian
  Church</i> appeared in 1857. His dogmatic position seems to be
  intermediate between the extreme school of naturalists, such as Heinrich
  Paulus, J.F. Röhr and Julius Wegscheider on the one hand, and D.F.
  Strauss and F.C. Baur on the other. Recognizing a supernatural element in
  the Bible, he nevertheless allowed to the full the critical exercise of
  reason in the interpretation of its dogmas (cp. Otto Pfleiderer,
  <i>Development of Theology</i>, pp. 89 ff.).</p>
      <p>See his autobiography, <i>Aus meinem Leben: Selbstbiographie von K.G.
  Bretschneider</i> (Gotha, 1851), of which a translation, with notes, by
  Professor George E. Day, appeared in the <i>Bibliotheca Sacra and
  American Biblical Repository</i>, Nos. 36 and 38 (1852, 1853); Neudecker
  in <i>Die allgemeine Kirchenzeitung</i> (1848), No. 38; Wüstemann,
  <i>Bretschneideri Memoria</i> (1848); A.G. Farrar, <i>Critical History of
  Free Thought</i> (Bampton Lectures, 1862); Herzog-Hauck,
