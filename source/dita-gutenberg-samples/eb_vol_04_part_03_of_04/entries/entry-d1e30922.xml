   <title>BUCKLE, HENRY THOMAS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCKLE, HENRY THOMAS--> (1821-1862), English historian, author of
  the <i>History of Civilization</i>, the son of Thomas Henry Buckle, a
  wealthy London merchant, was born at Lee, in Kent, on the 24th of
  November 1821. Owing to his delicate health he was only a very short time
  at school, and never at college, but the love of reading having been
  early awakened in him, he was allowed ample means of gratifying it. He
  gained his first distinctions not in literature but in chess, being
  reputed, before he was twenty, one of the first players in the world.
  After his father's death in January 1840 he spent some time with his
  mother on the continent (1840-1844). He had by that time formed the
  resolution to direct all his reading and to devote all his energies to
  the preparation of some great historical work, and during the next
  seventeen years he bestowed ten hours each day in working out his
  purpose. At first he contemplated a history of the middle ages, but by
  1851 he had decided in favour of a history of civilization. The six years
  which followed were occupied in writing and rewriting, altering and
  revising the first volume, which appeared in June 1857. It at once made
  its author a literary and even social celebrity,—the lion of a
  London season. On the 1st of March 1858 he delivered at the Royal
  Institution a public lecture (the only one he ever gave) on the
  <i>Influence of Women on the Progress of Knowledge</i>, which was
  published in <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> for April 1858, and reprinted in
  the first volume of the <i>Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works</i>. On the
  1st of April 1859 a crushing and desolating affliction fell upon him in
  the death of his mother. It was under the immediate impression of his
  loss that he concluded a review he was writing of J.S. Mill's <i>Essay on
  Liberty</i> with an argument for immortality, based on the yearning of
  the affections to regain communion with the beloved dead,—on the
  impossibility of standing up and living, if we believed the separation
  were final. The argument is a strange one to have been used by a man who
  had maintained so strongly that "we have the testimony of all history to
  prove the extreme fallibility of consciousness." The review appeared in
  <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>, May 1859, and is to be found also in the
  <i>Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works</i> (1872). The second volume of
  his history was published in May 1861. Soon after he left England for the
  East, in order to recruit his spirits and restore his health. From the
  end of October 1861 to the beginning of March 1862 was spent by him in
  Egypt, from which he went over the desert of Sinai and of Edom to Syria,
  reaching Jerusalem on the 19th of April 1862. After staying there eleven
  days, he set out for Europe by Beyrout, but at Nazareth he was attacked
  by fever; and he died at Damascus on the 29th of May 1862.</p>
      <p>Buckle's fame, which must rest wholly on his <i>History of
  Civilization in England</i>, is no longer what it was in the decade
  following his death. His <i>History</i> is a gigantic unfinished
  introduction, of which the plan was, first to state the general
  principles of the author's method and the general laws which govern the
  course of human progress; and secondly, to exemplify these principles and
  laws through the histories of certain nations characterized by prominent
  and peculiar features,—Spain and Scotland, the United States and
  Germany. Its chief ideas are—(1) That, owing partly to the want of
  ability in historians, and partly to the complexity of social phenomena,
  extremely little had as yet been done towards discovering the principles
  which govern the character and destiny of nations, or, in other words,
  towards establishing a science of history; (2) That, while the
  theological dogma of predestination is a barren hypothesis beyond the
  province of knowledge, and the metaphysical dogma of free will rests on
  an erroneous belief in the infallibility of consciousness, it is proved
  by science, and especially by statistics, that human actions are governed
  by laws as fixed and regular as those which rule in the physical world;
  (3) That climate, soil, food, and the aspects of nature are the primary
  causes of intellectual progress,—the first three indirectly,
  through determining the accumulation and distribution of wealth, and the
  last by directly influencing the accumulation and distribution of
  thought, the imagination being stimulated and the understanding subdued
  when the phenomena of the external world are sublime and terrible, the
  understanding being emboldened and the imagination curbed when they are
  small and feeble; (4) That the great division between European and
  non-European civilization turns on the fact that in Europe man is
  stronger than nature, and that elsewhere nature is stronger than man, the
  consequence of which is that in Europe alone has man subdued nature to
  his service; (5) That the advance of European civilization is
  characterized by a continually diminishing influence of physical laws,
  and a continually increasing influence of mental laws; (6) That the
  mental laws which regulate the progress of society cannot be discovered
  by the metaphysical method, that is, by the introspective study of the
  individual mind, but only by such a comprehensive survey of facts as will
  enable us to eliminate disturbances, that is, by the method of averages;
  (7) That human progress has been due, not to moral agencies, which are
  stationary, and which balance one another in such a manner that their
  influence is unfelt over any long period, but to intellectual activity,
  which has been constantly varying and advancing:—"The actions of
  individuals are greatly affected by their moral feelings and passions;
  but these being antagonistic to the passions and feelings of other
  individuals, are balanced by them, so that their effect is, in the great
  average of human affairs, nowhere to be seen, and the total actions of
  mankind, considered as a whole, are left to be regulated by the total
  knowledge of which mankind is possessed"; (8) That individual efforts are
  insignificant in the great mass of human affairs, and that great men,
  although they exist, and must "at present" be looked upon as disturbing
  forces, are merely the creatures of the age to which they belong; (9)
  That religion, literature and government are, at the best, the products
  and not the causes of civilization; (10) That the progress of
  civilization varies directly as "scepticism," the disposition to doubt
  and to investigate, and inversely as "credulity" or "the protective
  spirit," a disposition to maintain, without examination, established
  beliefs and practices.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately Buckle either could not define, or cared not to define,
  the general conceptions with which he worked, such as those denoted by
  the terms "civilization," "history," "science," "law," "scepticism," and
  "protective spirit"; the consequence is that his arguments are often
  fallacies. Moreover, the looseness of his statements and the rashness of
  his inferences regarding statistical averages make him, as a great
  authority has remarked, the <i>enfant terrible</i> of moral
  statisticians. He brought a vast amount of information from the most
  varied and distant sources to confirm his opinions, and the abundance of
  his materials never perplexed or burdened him in his argumentation, but
  examples of well-conducted historical argument are rare in his pages. He
  sometimes altered and contorted the facts; he very often unduly
  simplified his problems; he was very apt when he had proved a favourite
  opinion true to infer it to be the whole truth. On the other hand, many
  of his ideas have passed into the common literary stock, and have been
  more precisely elaborated by later writers on sociology and history; and
  though his own work is now somewhat neglected, its influence was
  immensely valuable in provoking further research and speculation.</p>
