   <body>
      <p><!--BRESSANT, JEAN BAPTISTE PROSPER--> (1815-1886), French actor, was
  born at Chalon-sur-Saône on the 23rd of October 1815, and began his stage
  career at the Variétés in Paris in 1833. In 1838 he went to the French
  theatre at St Petersburg, where for eight years he played important parts
  with ever-increasing reputation. His success was confirmed at the Gymnase
  when he returned to Paris in 1846, and he made his <i>début</i> at the
  Comédie Française as a full-fledged <i>sociétaire</i> in 1854. From
  playing the ardent young lover, he turned to leading rôles both in modern
  plays and in the classical répertoire. His Richelieu in <i>Mlle de
  Belle-Isle</i>, his Octave in Alfred de Musset's <i>Les Caprices de
  Marianne</i>, and his appearance in de Musset's <i>Il faut qu'une porte
  soit ouverte ou fermée</i> and <i>Un caprice</i> were followed by
  <i>Tartuffe</i>, <i>Le Misanthrope</i> and <i>Don Juan</i>. Bressant
  retired in 1875, and died on the 23rd of January 1886. During his
  professorship at the Conservatoire, Mounet-Sully was one of his
  pupils.</p>
