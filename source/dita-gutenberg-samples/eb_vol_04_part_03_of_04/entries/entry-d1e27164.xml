      <p><!--BRYAXIS,--> one of the four great sculptors who worked on the
  mausoleum at Halicarnassus, about 350 <ph outputclass="scac">B.C.</ph> His
  work on that monument cannot be separated from that of his companions,
  but a basis has been discovered at Athens bearing his signature, and
  adorned with figures of horsemen in relief. He is said to have made a
  great statue of Serapis for Sinope, but as to this there are grave
  historic difficulties. He also made a great statue of Apollo, set up at
  Daphne near Antioch (see E.A. Gardner, <i>Handbook of Greek
  Sculpture</i>, ii. 374).</p>
