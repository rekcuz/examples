   <title>BRETÓN DE LOS HERREROS, MANUEL</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRETÓN DE LOS HERREROS, MANUEL--> (1796-1873), Spanish dramatist,
  was born at Quel (Logroño) on the 19th of December 1796 and was educated
  at Madrid. Enlisting on the 24th of May 1812, he served against the
  French in Valencia and Catalonia, and retired with the rank of corporal
  on the 8th of March 1822. He obtained a minor post in the civil service
  under the liberal government, and on his discharge determined to earn his
  living by writing for the stage. His first piece, <i>Á la vejez
  viruelas</i>, was produced on the 14th of October 1824, and proved the
  writer to be the legitimate successor of the younger Moratin. His
  industry was astonishing: between October 1824 and November 1828, he
  composed thirty-nine plays, six of them original, the rest being
  translations or recasts of classic masterpieces. In 1831 he published a
  translation of Tibullus, and acquired by it an unmerited reputation for
  scholarship which secured for him an appointment as sub-librarian at the
  national library. But the theatre claimed him for its own, and with the
  exception of <i>Elena</i> and a few other pieces in the fashionable
  romantic vein, his plays were a long series of successes. His only
  serious check occurred in 1840; the former liberal had grown conservative
  with age, and in <i>La Ponchada</i> he ridiculed the National Guard. He
  was dismissed from the national library, and for a short time was so
  unpopular that he seriously thought of emigrating to America; but the
  storm blew over, and within two years Bretón de los Herreros had regained
  his supremacy on the stage. He became secretary to the Spanish Academy,
  quarrelled with his fellow-members, and died at Madrid on the 8th of
  November 1873. He is the author of some three hundred and sixty original
  plays, twenty-three of which are in prose. No Spanish dramatist of the
  nineteenth century approaches him in comic power, in festive invention,
  and in the humorous presentation of character, while his metrical
  dexterity is unique. <i>Marcela o a cual de los trés?</i> (1831),
  <i>Muérete; y verás!</i> (1837) and <i>La Escuela del matrimonio</i>
  (1852) still hold the stage, and are likely to hold it so long as Spanish
  is spoken.</p>
