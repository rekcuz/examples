   <title>BUCHAN, PETER</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BUCHAN, PETER--> (1790-1854), Scottish editor, was born at
  Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, in 1790. In 1816 he started in business as a
  printer at Peterhead, and was successful enough to be able eventually to
  retire and devote himself to the collection and editing of Scottish
  ballads. His <i>Ancient Ballads and Songs of the North of Scotland</i>
  (1828) contained a large number of hitherto unpublished ballads, and
  newly discovered versions of existing ones. Another collection made by
  him was published by the Percy Society, under the title <i>Scottish
  Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads</i> (1845). Two unpublished
  volumes of Buchan's ballad collections are in the British Museum. He died
  on the 19th of September 1854.</p>
