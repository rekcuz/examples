   <title>BRIDGE</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIDGE,--> a game of cards, developed out of the game of whist.
  The country of its origin is unknown. A similar game is said to have been
  played in Denmark in the middle of the 19th century. A game in all
  respects the same as bridge, except that in "no trumps" each trick
  counted ten instead of twelve, was played in England about 1884 under the
  name of Dutch whist. Some connect it with Turkey and Egypt under the name
  of "Khedive," or with a Russian game called "Yeralash." It was in Turkey
  that it first won a share of popular favour. Under the synonyms of
  "Biritch," "Bridge," or "Russian whist," it found its way to the London
  clubs about 1894, from which date its popularity rapidly increased.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Ordinary Bridge.</i>—Bridge, in its ordinary form, differs
  from <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page529">[v.04
  p.0529]</ph>whist in the following respects:—Although there are
  four players, yet in each hand the partner of the dealer takes no part in
  the play of that particular hand. After the first lead his cards are
  placed on the table exposed, and are played by the dealer as at dummy
  whist; nevertheless the dealer's partner is interested in the result of
  the hand equally with the dealer. The trump suit is not determined by the
  last card dealt, but is selected by the dealer or his partner without
  consultation, the former having the first option. It is further open to
  them to play without a trump suit. The value of tricks and honours varies
  with the suit declared as trumps. Honours are reckoned differently from
  whist, and on a scale which is somewhat involved. The score for honours
  does not count towards winning or losing the rubber, but is added
  afterwards to the trick score in order to determine the value of the
  rubber. There are also scores for holding no trumps ("chicane"), and for
  winning all the tricks or all but one ("slam").</p>
      <p>The score has to be kept on paper. It is usual for the scoring block
  to have two vertical columns divided halfway by a horizontal line. The
  left column is for the scorers' side, and the right for the opponents'.
  Honours are scored above the horizontal line, and tricks below. The
  drawback to this arrangement is that, since the scores for each hand are
  not kept separately, it is generally impossible to trace an error in the
  score without going through the whole series of hands. A better plan, it
  seems, is to have four columns ruled, the inner two being assigned to
  tricks, the outer ones to honours. By this method a line can be reserved
  for each hand, and any discrepancy in the scores at once rectified.</p>
      <p>The Portland Club, London, drew up a code of laws in 1895, and this
  code, with a few amendments, was in July 1895 adopted by a joint
  committee of the Turf and Portland Clubs. A revised code came into force
  in January 1905, the provisions of which are here summarized.</p>
      <p>Each trick above 6 counts 2 points in a spade declaration, 4 in a
  club, 6 in a diamond, 8 in a heart, 12 in a no-trump declaration. The
  game consists of 30 points made by tricks alone. When one side has won
  two games the rubber is ended. The winners are entitled to add 100 points
  to their score. Honours consist of ace, king, queen, knave, ten, in a
  suit declaration. If a player and his partner conjointly hold 3 (or
  "simple") honours they score twice the value of a trick; if 4 honours, 4
  times; if 5 honours, 5 times. If a player in his own hand hold 4 honours
  he is entitled to score 4 honours in addition to the score for conjoint
  honours; thus, if one player hold 4 honours and his partner the other
  their total score is 9 by honours. Similarly if a player hold 5 honours
  in his own hand he is entitled to score 10 by honours. If in a no-trump
  hand the partners conjointly hold 3 aces, they score 30 for honours; if 4
  aces, 40 for honours. 4 aces in 1 hand count 100. On the same footing as
  the score for honours are the following: <i>chicane</i>, if a player hold
  no trump, in amount equal to simple honours; <i>grand slam</i>, if one
  side win all the tricks, 40 points; <i>little slam</i>, if they win 12
  tricks, 20 points. At the end of the rubber the total scores, whether
  made by tricks, honours, chicane, slam, or rubber points, are added
  together, and the difference between the two totals is the number of
  points won.</p>
      <p>At the opening of play, partners are arranged and the cards are
  shuffled, cut and dealt (the last card not being turned) as at whist; but
  the dealer cannot lose the deal by misdealing. After the deal is
  completed, the dealer makes the trump or no-trump (<i>sans atout</i>)
  declaration, or passes the choice to his partner without remark. If the
  dealer's partner make the declaration out of his turn, the adversary on
  the dealer's left may, without consultation, claim a fresh deal. If an
  adversary make a declaration, the dealer may claim a fresh deal or
  disregard the declaration. Then after the declaration, either adversary
  may double, the leader having first option. The effect of doubling is
  that each trick is worth twice as many points as before; but the scores
  for honours, chicane and slam are unaltered. If a declaration is doubled,
  the dealer and his partner have the right of redoubling, thus making each
  trick worth four times as much as at first. The declarer has the first
  option. The other side can again redouble, and so on; but the value of a
  trick is limited to 100 points. In the play of the hand the laws are
  nearly the same as the laws of whist, except that the dealer may expose
  his cards and lead out of turn without penalty; after the second hand has
  played, however, he can only correct this lead out of turn with the
  permission of the adversaries. Dummy cannot revoke. The dealer's partner
  may take no part in the play of the hand beyond guarding the dealer
  against revoking.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Advice to Players.</i>—In the choice of a suit two objects
  are to be aimed at: first, to select the suit in which the combined
  forces have the best chance of making tricks; secondly, to select the
  trump so that the value of the suit agrees with the character of the
  hand, <i>i.e.</i> a suit of high value when the hands are strong and of
  low value when very weak. As the deal is a great advantage it generally
  happens that a high value is to be aimed at, but occasionally a low value
  is desirable. The task of selection should fall to the hand which has the
  most distinctive features, that is, either the longest suit or unusual
  strength or weakness. No consultation being allowed, the dealer must
  assume only an average amount of variation from the normal in his
  partner's hand. If his own hand has distinctive features beyond the
  average, he should name the trump suit himself, otherwise pass it to his
  partner. It may here be stated what is the average in these respects.</p>
      <p>As regards the length of a suit, a player's long suit is rather more
  likely to be fewer than five than over five. If the dealer has in his
  hand a suit of five cards including two honours, it is probable that he
  has a better suit to make trumps than dummy; if the suit is in hearts,
  and the dealer has a fair hand, he ought to name the trump. As regards
  strength, the average hand would contain ace, king, queen, knave and ten,
  or equivalent strength. Hands stronger or weaker than this by the value
  of a king or less may be described as featureless. If the dealer's hand
  is a king over the average, it is more likely than not that his partner
  will either hold a stronger hand, or will hold such a weak hand as will
  counteract the player's strength. The dealer would not generally with
  such a hand declare no trump, especially as by making a no-trump
  declaration the dealer forfeits the advantage of holding the long
  trumps.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Declarations by Dealer.</i>—In calculating the strength of a
  hand a knave is worth two tens, a queen is worth two knaves, a king is
  worth a queen and knave together, and an ace is worth a king and queen
  together. A king unguarded is worth less than a queen guarded; a queen is
  not fully guarded unless accompanied by three more cards; if guarded by
  one small card it is worth a knave guarded. An ace also loses in value by
  being sole.</p>
      <p>A hand to be strong enough for a no-trump declaration should be a king
  and ten above the average with all the honours guarded and all the suits
  protected. It must be a king and knave or two queens above the average if
  there is protection in three suits. It must be an ace or a king and queen
  above the average if only two suits are protected. An established black
  suit of six or more cards with a guarded king as card of entry is good
  enough for no trumps. With three aces no trumps can be declared. Without
  an ace, four kings, two queens and a knave are required in order to
  justify the declaration. When the dealer has a choice of declarations, a
  sound heart make is to be preferred to a doubtful no-trump. Four honours
  in hearts are to be preferred to any but a very strong no-trump
  declaration; but four aces counting 100 points constitute a no-trump
  declaration without exception.</p>
      <p>Six hearts should be made trumps and five with two honours unless the
  hand is very weak; five hearts with one honour or four hearts with three
  honours should be declared if the hand is nearly strong enough for no
  trumps, also if the hand is very irregular with one suit missing or five
  of a black suit. Six diamonds with one honour, five with three honours or
  four all honours should be declared; weaker diamonds should be declared
  if the suits are irregular, especially if blank in hearts. Six clubs with
  three honours or five with four honours should be declared. Spades are
  practically only declared with a weak hand; with only a king in the hand
  a suit of five spades should be declared as a defensive measure. With
  nothing above a ten a suit of two or three spades can be declared, though
  even with the weakest hands a suit of five clubs or of six red cards will
  probably prove less expensive.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Declarations by Dummy.</i>—From the fact that the call has
  been passed, the dealer's partner must credit the dealer with less than
  average strength as regards the rank of his cards, and probably a
  slightly increased number of black cards; he must therefore be more
  backward in making a high declaration whenever he can make a sound
  declaration of less value. On the other hand, he has not the option of
  passing the declaration, and may be driven to declare on less strength
  because the only alternative is a short suit of spades. For example, with
  the hand: Hearts, ace, kv. 2; diamonds, qn. 9, 7, 6, 3; clubs, kg. 10, 4;
  spades, 9, 2, the chances are in the dealer's favour with five trumps,
  but decidedly against with only two, and the diamond declaration is to be
  preferred to the spade. Still, a hand may be so weak that spades should
  be declared with two or less, but five clubs or six diamonds would be
  preferable with the weakest of hands.</p>
      <p>
         <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page530">[v.04 p.0530]</ph>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>Declarations to the Score.</i>—When one's score is over
  twenty, club declarations should be made more frequently by the dealer.
  Spades should be declared with six at the score of twenty-six and with
  five at twenty-eight. When much behind in the score a risky no-trumper
  such as one with an established suit of seven or eight cards without a
  card of entry, may be declared.</p>
      <p>Declaring to the score is often overdone; an ordinary weak no-trump
  declaration carries with it small chances of three by tricks unless dummy
  holds a no-trump hand.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Doubling.</i>—Practically the leader only doubles a no-trump
  declaration when he holds what is probably an established suit of seven
  cards or a suit which can be established with the loss of one trick and
  he has good cards of re-entry. Seven cards of a suit including the ace,
  king and queen make sound double without any other card of value in the
  hand, or six cards including king, queen and knave with two aces in other
  suits.</p>
      <p>Doubling by the third hand is universally understood to mean that the
  player has a very strong suit which he can establish. In response to the
  double his partner, according to different conventions, leads either a
  heart or his own shortest suit as the one most likely to be the third
  player's strongest. Under the short suit convention, if the doubler holds
  six of a suit headed by the ace, king and queen, it is about an even
  chance that his suit will be selected; he should not double with less
  strength. Under the heart convention it is not necessary to have such
  great strength; with a strong suit of six hearts and good cards of
  re-entry, enough tricks will be saved to compensate for the doubled
  value. A player should ascertain the convention followed before beginning
  to play.</p>
      <p>Before doubling a suit declaration a player should feel almost certain
  that he is as strong as the declarer. The minimum strength to justify the
  declaration is generally five trumps, but it may have been made on six.
  If, then, a player holds six trumps with an average hand as regards the
  rank of his cards, or five trumps with a hand of no-trump strength, it is
  highly probable that he is as strong as the declarer. It must be further
  taken into account that the act of doubling gives much valuable
  information to the dealer, who would otherwise play with the expectation
  of finding the trumps evenly distributed; this is counterbalanced when
  the doubler is on the left of the declaring hand by the intimation given
  to his partner to lead trumps through the strong hand. In this position,
  then, the player should double with the strength stated above. When on
  the declarer's right, the player should hold much greater strength unless
  his hand is free from tenaces. When a spade declaration has been made by
  dummy, one trump less is necessary and the doubler need not be on the
  declarer's left. A spade declaration by the dealer can be doubled with
  even less strength. A declaration can be rather more freely doubled when
  a single trick undoubled will take the dealer out, but even in this
  position the player must be cautious of informing the dealer that there
  is a strong hand against him.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Redoubling.</i>—When a declaration has been doubled, the
  declarer knows the minimum that he will find against him; he must be
  prepared to find occasionally strength against him considerably exceeding
  this minimum. Except in the case of a spade declaration, cases in which
  redoubling is justifiable are very rare.</p>
      <p>
         <i>The Play of the Hand.</i>—In a no-trump declaration the main
  object is to bring in a long suit. In selecting the suit to establish,
  the following are favourable conditions:—One hand should hold at
  least five cards of the suit. The two hands, unless with a sequence of
  high cards, should hold between them eight cards of the suit, so as to
  render it probable that the suit will be established in three rounds. The
  hand which contains the strong suit should be sufficiently strong in
  cards of re-entry. The suit should not be so full of possible tenaces as
  to make it disadvantageous to open it. As regards the play of the cards
  in a suit, it is not the object to make tricks early, but to make all
  possible tricks. Deep finesses should be made when there is no other way
  of stealing a trick. Tricks may be given away, if by so doing a
  favourable opening can be made for a finesse. When, however, it is
  doubtful with which hand the finesse should be made, it is better to
  leave it as late as possible, since the card to be finessed against may
  fall, or an adversary may fail, thus disclosing the suit. It is in
  general unsound to finesse against a card that must be unguarded. From a
  hand short in cards of re-entry, winning cards should not be led out so
  as to exhaust the suit from the partner's hand. Even a trick should
  sometimes be given away. For instance, if one hand holds seven cards
  headed by ace, king, and the other hand hold's only two of the suit,
  although there is a fair chance of making seven tricks in the suit, it
  would often be right to give the first trick to the adversaries. When one
  of the adversaries has shown a long suit, it is frequently possible to
  prevent its being brought in by a device, such as holding up a winning
  card, until the suit is exhausted from his partner's hand, or playing in
  other suits so as to give the player the lead whilst his partner his a
  card of his suit to return, and to give the latter the lead when he has
  no card to return. The dealer should give as little information as
  possible as to what he holds in his own hand, playing frequent false
  cards. Usually he should play the higher or highest of a sequence; still,
  there are positions in which playing the higher gives more information
  than the lower; a strict adherence to a rule in itself assists the
  adversaries.</p>
      <p>With a suit declaration, if there is no chance of letting the weak
  hand make a trump by ruffing, it will generally be the dealer's aim to
  discard the losing cards in the declaring hand either to high cards or to
  the cards of an established suit in the other hand, sometimes after the
  adverse trumps have been taken out, but often before, there being no time
  for drawing trumps. With no card of any value in a suit in one hand, the
  lead should come from that hand, but it is better, if possible, to let
  the adversaries open the suit. It is generally useless to lead a
  moderately high card from the weaker hand in order to finesse it, when
  holding no cards in sequence with it in either hand. Sometimes
  (especially in no-trumps) it is the better play to make the weak hand
  third player. For instance, with king, 8, 7, 5, 2 in one hand, knave, 4
  in the other, the best way of opening is from the hand that holds five
  cards.</p>
      <p>In a no-trump declaration the opponents of the dealer should endeavour
  to find the longest suit in the two hands, or the one most easily
  established. With this object the leader should open his best suit. If
  his partner next obtains the lead he ought to return the suit, unless he
  himself has a suit which he considers better, having due regard to the
  fact that the first suit is already partially established. The opponents
  should employ the same tactics as the dealer to prevent the latter from
  bringing in a long suit; they can use them with special effect when the
  long suit is in the exposed hand.</p>
      <p>Against no-trumps the leader should not play his winning cards unless
  he has a good chance of clearing the suit without help from his partner;
  in most cases it is advisable to give away the first trick, especially if
  he has no card of re-entry, in order that his partner on gaining the lead
  may have a card of the suit to return; but holding ace, king and queen,
  or ace, king with seven in the suit, or ace, king, knave, ten with six,
  the player may lead out his best. With three honours any two of which are
  in sequence (not to the ace) the player should lead the higher of the
  sequence. He should lead his highest card from queen, knave, ten; from
  queen, knave, nine; from knave, ten, nine; knave, ten, eight, and ten,
  nine, eight. In other cases the player should lead a small card;
  according to the usual convention, the fourth best. His partner, and also
  the dealer, can credit him with three cards higher than the card led, and
  can often place the cards of the suit: for instance, the seven is led,
  dummy holds queen and eight, playing the queen, the third player holds
  the nine and smaller cards; the unseen cards higher than the seven are
  ace, king, knave and ten of which the leader must hold three; he cannot
  hold both knave and ten or he would have led the knave; he must therefore
  hold the ace, king and either knave or ten. The "eleven" rule is as
  follows: the number of pips in the card led subtracted from eleven
  (11-7=4 in the case stated) gives the number of cards higher than the one
  led not in the leader's hand; the three cards seen (queen, nine and
  eight) leave one for the dealer to hold. The mental process is no shorter
  than assigning three out of the unseen cards to the leader, and by not
  noting the unseen cards much valuable information may be missed, as in
  the illustrative case given.</p>
      <p>With a suit declared the best opening lead is a singleton, failing
  which a lead from a strong sequence. A lead from a tenace or a guarded
  king or queen is to be avoided. Two small cards may be led from, though
  the lead is objected to by some. A suit of three small cards of no great
  strength should not be opened. In cases of doubt preference should be
  given to hearts and to a less extent to diamonds.</p>
      <p>To lead up to dummy's weak suits is a valuable rule. The converse, to
  lead through strength, must be used with caution, and does not apply to
  no-trump declarations. It is not advisable to adopt any of the recent
  whist methods of giving information. It is clear that, if the adversaries
  signal, the dealer's hand alone is a secret, and he, in addition to his
  natural advantage, has the further advantage of better information than
  either of the adversaries. The following signals are however, used, and
  are of great trick-making value: playing an unnecessarily high card,
  whether to one's partner's suit or in discarding in a no-trump
  declaration, indicates strength in the suit; in a suit declaration a
  similar method of play indicates two only of the suit and a desire to
  ruff,—it is best used in the case of a king led by one's
  partner.</p>
      <p>The highest of a sequence led through dummy will frequently tell the
  third player that he has a good finesse. The lowest of a sequence led
  through the dealer will sometimes explain the position to the third
  player, at the same time keeping the dealer in the dark.</p>
      <p>When on dummy's left it is futile to finesse against a card not in
  dummy's hand. But with ace and knave, if dummy has either king or queen,
  the knave should usually be played, partly because the other high card
  may be in the leader's hand, partly because, if the finesse fails, the
  player may still hold a tenace over dummy. When a player is with any
  chance of success trying to establish his long suit, he should keep every
  card of it if possible, whether it is a suit already opened or a suit
  which he wishes his partner to lead; when, however, the main object of
  the hand is to establish one's partner's suit, it is not necessary for a
  player to keep his own long suit, and he should pay attention to guarding
  the other suits. In some circles a discard from a suit is always
  understood to indicate strength in the suit; this convention, while it
  makes the game easier for inferior players, frequently causes the player
  to throw away one of his most valuable cards.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Playing to the Score.</i>—At the beginning of the hand the
  chances are so great against any particular result, that at the score of
  love-all the advantage of getting to any particular score has no
  appreciable <ph outputclass="pagenum" id="page531">[v.04 p.0531]</ph>effect in determining the choice
  of suit. In the play of the hand, the advantage of getting to certain
  points should be borne in mind. The principal points to be aimed at are
  6, 18, and, in a less degree, 22. The reason is that the scores 24, 12
  and 8, which will just take the dealer out from the respective points,
  can each be made in a variety of ways, and are the most common for the
  dealer to make. The 2 points that take the score from 4 to 6 are worth 4,
  or perhaps 5, average points; and the 2 points that take the score from 6
  to 8 are worth 1 point. When approaching game it is an advantage to make
  a declaration that may just take the player out, and, in a smaller
  degree, one that will not exactly take the adversaries out. When the
  score is 24 to 22 against the dealer, hearts and clubs are half a trick
  better relatively to diamonds than at the score of love-all. In the first
  and second games of the rubber the value of each point scored for honours
  is probably about a half of a point scored for tricks—in a close
  game rather less, in a one-sided game rather more. In the deciding game
  of the rubber, on account of the importance of winning the game, the
  value of each point scored for honours sinks to one-third of a point
  scored for tricks.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Other Forms of Bridge.</i>—The following varieties of the
  game are also played:—</p>
      <p>
         <i>Three-handed Bridge.</i>—The three players cut; the one that
  cuts the lowest card deals, and takes dummy for one deal: each takes
  dummy in turn. Dummy's cards are dealt face downwards, and the dealer
  declares without seeing them. If the dealer declares trumps, both
  adversaries may look at their hands; doubling and redoubling proceeds as
  at ordinary bridge, but dummy's hand is not exposed till the first card
  has been led. If the dealer passes the declaration to dummy, his
  right-hand adversary, who must not have looked at his own hand, examines
  dummy's, and declares trumps, not, however, exposing the hand. The
  declaration is forced: with three or four aces <i>sans atout</i> (no
  trumps) must be declared: in other cases the longest suit: if suits are
  equal in length, the strongest, <i>i.e.</i> the suit containing most
  pips, ace counting eleven, king, queen and knave counting ten each. If
  suits are equal in both length and strength, the one in which the trick
  has the higher value must be trumps. On the dummy's declaration the third
  player can only double before seeing his own cards. When the first card
  has been led, dummy's hand is exposed, never before the lead. The game is
  30: the player wins the rubber who is the first to win two games. Fifty
  points are scored for each game won, and fifty more for the rubber.
  Sometimes three games are played without reference to a rubber, fifty
  points being scored for a game won. No tricks score towards game except
  those which a player wins in his own deal; the value of tricks won in
  other deals is scored above the line with honours, slam and chicane. At
  the end of the rubber the totals are added up, and the points won or lost
  are adjusted thus. Suppose A is credited with 212, B with 290, and C with
  312, then A owes 78 to B and 100 to C; B owes 22 to C.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Dummy Bridge.</i>—The player who cuts the lowest card takes
  dummy. Dummy deals the first hand of all. The player who takes dummy
  always looks at his own hand first, when he deals for himself or for
  dummy; he can either declare trumps or "leave it" to dummy. Dummy's
  declaration is compulsory, as in three-handed bridge. When the dealer
  deals for dummy, the player on the dealer's <i>left</i> must not look at
  his cards till either the dealer has declared trumps or, the declaration
  having been left to dummy, his own partner has led a card. The latter can
  double, but his partner can only double without seeing his hand. The
  dealer can only redouble on his own hand. When the player of dummy deals
  for himself, the player on his <i>right</i> hand looks at dummy's hand if
  the declaration is passed, the positions and restrictions of his partner
  and himself being reversed. If the player of dummy declares from his own
  hand, the game proceeds as in ordinary bridge, except that dummy's hand
  is not looked at till permission to play has been given. When the player
  on dummy's right deals, dummy's partner may look at dummy's hand to
  decide if he will double, but he may not look at his own till a card has
  been led by dummy. In another form of dummy bridge two hands are exposed
  whenever dummy's adversaries deal, but the game is unsuited for many
  players, as in every other hand the game is one of double-dummy.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Misery Bridge.</i>—This is a form of bridge adapted for two
  players. The non-dealer has the dummy, whilst the dealer is allowed to
  strengthen his hand by discarding four or fewer cards and taking an equal
  number from the fourth packet dealt; the rest of the cards in that packet
  are unused and remain unseen. A novel and interesting addition to the
  game is that the three of clubs (called "Cato") does not rank as a club
  but can be played to any trick and win it. The dealer, in addition to his
  other calls, may declare "misery" when he has to make less than two
  tricks.</p>
      <p>
         <i>Draw- or Two-handed Bridge.</i>—This is the best form of
  bridge for two players. Each player has a dummy, which is placed opposite
  to him; but the cards are so arranged that they cannot be seen by his
  opponent, a special stand being required for the purpose. The dealer
  makes the declaration or passes it to his dummy to make by the same rules
  as in three-handed or dummy bridge. The objection to this is that, since

         <i>Auction Bridge.</i>—This variety of the game for four
  players, which adds an element characteristic of poker, appears to have
  been suggested about 1904, but was really introduced at the Bath Club,
  London, in 1907, and then was gradually taken up by a wider circle. The
  laws were settled in August 1908 by a joint committee of the Bath and
  Portland clubs. The scoring (except as below), value of suits, and play
  are as at ordinary bridge, but the variety consists in the method of
  declaration, the declaration not being confined in auction bridge to the
  dealer or his partner, and the deal being a disadvantage rather than
  otherwise. The dealer, having examined his hand, <i>must</i> declare to
  win at least one "odd" trick, and then each player in turn, beginning
  with the one on the dealer's left, has the right to pass the previous
  declaration, or double, or redouble, or overcall by making a declaration
  of higher value any number of times till all are satisfied, the actual
  play of the combined hands (or what in ordinary bridge would be dealer
  and dummy) resting eventually with the partners making the final
  declaration; the partner who made the first call (however small) in the
  suit finally constituting the trump (or no-trump) plays the hands, the
  other being dummy. A declaration of a greater number of tricks in a suit
  of lower value, which equals a previous call in value of points
  (<i>e.g.</i> two in spades as against one in clubs) is "of higher value";
  but doubling and redoubling only affect the score and not the
  declaration, so that a call of two diamonds overcalls one no-trump even
  though this has been doubled. The scoring in auction bridge has the
  additional element that when the eventual player of the two hands wins
  what was ultimately declared or more, his side score the full value below
  the line (as tricks), but if he fails the opponents score 50 points above
  the line (as honours) for each under-trick (<i>i.e.</i> trick short of
  the declaration), or 100 or 200 if doubled or redoubled, nothing being
  scored by either side below the line; the loss on a declaration of one
  spade is limited, however, to a maximum of 100 points. A player whose
  declaration has been doubled and who fulfils his contract, scores a bonus
  of 50 points above the line and a further 50 points for each additional
  trick beyond his declaration; if there was a redouble and he wins, he
  scores double the bonus. The penalty for a revoke (unaffected by a
  double) is (1) in the case of the declarer, that his adversaries add 150
  above the line; (2) in the case of one of his adversaries, that the
  declarer may either add 150 points above the line or may take three
  tricks from his opponents and add them to his own; in the latter case
  such tricks may assist him to fulfil his contract, but shall not entitle
  him to any bonus for a double or redouble. A revoking side may score
  nothing either above or below the line except for honours or chicane. As
  regards the essential feature of auction bridge, the competitive
  declaration, it is impossible here to discuss the intricacies involved.
  It entails, clearly, much reliance on a good partner, since the various
  rounds of bidding enable good players to draw inferences as to where the
  cards lie. The game opens the door to much larger scores than ordinary
  bridge, and since the end only comes from scores made below the line,
  there are obvious ways of prolonging it at the cost of scores above the
  line which involve much more of the gambling element. It by no means
  follows that the winner of the rubber is the winner by points, and many
  players prefer to go for points (<i>i.e.</i> above the line) extorted
  from their opponents rather than for fulfilling a declaration made by
  themselves.</p>
