   <title>BRIAREUS</title>
   <body>
      <p><!--BRIAREUS,--> or <ph outputclass="sc">Aegaeon</ph>, in Greek
  mythology, one of the three hundred-armed, fifty-headed Hecatoncheires,
  brother of Cottus and Gyges (or Gyes). According to Homer (<i>Iliad</i>
  i. 403) he was called Aegaeon by men, and Briareus by the gods. He was
  the son of Poseidon (or Uranus) and Gaea. The legends regarding him and
  his brothers are various and somewhat contradictory. According to the
  most widely spread myth, Briareus and his brothers were called by Zeus to
  his assistance when the Titans were making war upon Olympus. The gigantic
  enemies were defeated and consigned to Tartarus, at the gates of which
  the three brothers were placed (Hesiod, <i>Theog.</i> 624, 639, 714).
  Other accounts make Briareus one of the assailants of Olympus, who, after
  his defeat, was buried under Mount Aetna (Callimachus, <i>Hymn to
  Delos</i>, 141). Homer mentions him as assisting Zeus when the other
  Olympian deities were plotting against the king of gods and men
  (<i>Iliad</i> i. 398). Another tradition makes him a giant of the sea,
  ruler of the fabulous Aegaea in Euboea, an enemy of Poseidon and the
  inventor of warships (Schol. on Apoll. Rhod. i. 1165). It would be
  difficult to determine exactly what natural phenomena are symbolized by
  the Hecatoncheires. They may represent the gigantic forces of nature
  which appear in earthquakes and other convulsions, or the multitudinous
  motion of the sea waves (Mayer, <i>Die Giganten und Titanen</i>,
  1887).</p>
