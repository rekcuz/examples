         <p>The Evolution-idea is a master-key that opens many doors. It is a luminous
 interpretation of the world, throwing the light of the past upon the present.
 Everything is seen to be an antiquity, with a history behind it—a
 <i>natural history</i>, which enables us to understand in some measure how it
 has come to be as it is. We cannot say more than "understand in some
 measure," for while the <i>fact</i> of evolution is certain, we are only
 beginning to discern the <i>factors</i> that have been at work.</p>
         <p>The evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek
 philosophers, but it is only in modern times that it has become an essential
 part of our mental equipment. It is now an everyday intellectual tool. It was
 applied to the origin of the solar system and to the making of the earth
 before it was applied to plants and animals; it was extended from these to
 man himself; it spread to language, to folk-ways, to institutions. Within
 recent years the evolution-idea has been applied to the chemical elements,
 for it appears that uranium may change into radium, that radium may produce
 helium, and that lead is the final stable result when the changes of uranium
 are complete. Perhaps all the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic
 evolution. Not less important is the extension of the evolution-idea to the
 world within as well as to the world without. For alongside of the evolution
 of bodies and brains is the evolution of feelings and emotions, ideas and
 imagination.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 56]</ph>
         </p>
         <p>Organic evolution means that the present is the child of the past and the
 parent of the future. It is not a power or a principle; it is a
 process—a process of becoming. It means that the present-day animals
 and plants and all the subtle inter-relations between them have arisen in a
 natural knowable way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole somewhat
 simpler, and that again from forms and inter-relations simpler still, and so
 on backwards and backwards for millions of years till we lose all clues in
 the thick mist that hangs over life's beginnings.</p>
         <p>Our solar system was once represented by a nebula of some sort, and we may
 speak of the evolution of the sun and the planets. But since it has been
 <i>the same material throughout</i> that has changed in its distribution and
 forms, it might be clearer to use some word like genesis. Similarly, our
 human institutions were once very different from what they are now, and we
 may speak of the evolution of government or of cities. But Man works with a
 purpose, with ideas and ideals in some measure controlling his actions and
 guiding his achievements, so that it is probably clearer to keep the good old
 word history for all processes of social becoming in which man has been a
 conscious agent. Now between the genesis of the solar system and the history
 of civilisation there comes the vast process of organic evolution. The word
 development should be kept for the becoming of the individual, the chick out
 of the egg, for instance.</p>
         <p>Organic evolution is a continuous natural process of racial change, by
 successive steps in a definite direction, whereby distinctively new
 individualities arise, take root, and flourish, sometimes alongside of, and
 sometimes, sooner or later, in place of, the originative stock. Our
 domesticated breeds of pigeons and poultry are the results of evolutionary
 change whose origins are still with us in the Rock Dove and the Jungle Fowl;
 but in most cases in Wild Nature the ancestral stocks of present-day forms
 are long since extinct, and in many cases they are unknown. Evolution is a
 long process of coming and going, appearing and disappearing,<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 57]</ph> a long-drawn-out
 sublime process like a great piece of music.</p>

            <p>When we speak the language of science we cannot say "In the
 beginning," for we do not know of and cannot think of any condition of
 things that did not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify
 the phrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within
 the solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and the
 planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The nebula has
 to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have been a
 pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, "In the beginning
 was Mind," we may be expressing or trying to express a great truth, but
 we have gone <ph outputclass="smcap">BEYOND SCIENCE</ph>.</p>

            <ph outputclass="title-line">The Nebular Hypothesis</ph> 
         </title>
         <body>
            <p>One of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown upon
 the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to Laplace's
 famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a gigantic
 glowing mass, spinning slowly and uniformly around its centre. As the
 incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation increased
 the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which broke up and
 gathered together again as the first and most distant planet. The main mass
 gave off another ring and another till all the planets, including the earth,
 were formed. The central mass persisted as the sun.</p>
            <p>Laplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years
 before, with scientific caution: "conjectures which I present with all
 the distrust which everything not the result of observation or of calculation
 ought to inspire." Subsequent research justified his distrust, for it
 has been shown that the original nebula need not have been hot and need not
 have been gaseous.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 58]</ph> Moreover, there are great difficulties in Laplace's theory
 of the separation of successive rings from the main mass, and of the
 condensation of a whirling gaseous ring into a planet.</p>
            <p>So it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving as
 a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman Lockyer
 pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself millions of
 meteorites every day; this has been going on for millions of years; in
 distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and voluminous;
 and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions are undoubted,
 but they require a centre to attract them, and the difficulty is to account
 for the beginning of a collecting centre or planetary nucleus. Moreover,
 meteorites are sporadic and erratic, scattered hither and thither rather than
 collecting into unit-bodies. As Professor Chamberlin says, "meteorites
 have rather the characteristics of the wreckage of some earlier organisation
 than of the parentage of our planetary system." Several other theories
 have been propounded to account for the origin of the earth, but the one that
 has found most favour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and
 Moulton. According to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the
 sun, from which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,
 the earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ, like
 many of those now observed in the heavens.</p>
            <p>Of great importance were the "knots," for they served as
 collecting centres drawing flying matter into their clutches. Whatever part
 of the primitive bolt escaped and scattered was drawn out into independent
 orbits round the sun, forming the "planetesimals" which behave like
 minute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots
 subsequently fed.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>It has been calculated that the newborn earth—the
 "earth-knot" of Chamberlin's theory—had a diameter of
 about 5,500<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 59]</ph> miles. But it grew by drawing planetesimals into itself until
 it had a diameter of over 8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since
 then it has shrunk, by periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up
 of successive series of mountains, and it has now a diameter of 7,918 miles.
 But during the shrinking the earth became more varied.</p>
            <p>A sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten
 matter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual
 assortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials
 deeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as
 granites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier
 materials such as basalts. In limited areas land has often become sea, and
 sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the
 distinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and oceans
 goes back to a very early stage.</p>
            <p>The lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may
 have been, to begin with, about fifty miles in thickness. It seems that the
 young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water began to
 accumulate on its surface—before, in other words, there was any
 hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with, and it was
 long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter from the exposed
 rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the high grounds of the
 ancient crust by air and water furnished the material which formed the
 sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary rocks, which are said to
 amount to a thickness of over fifty miles in all.</p>

         <body>
            <p>It is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble conditions
 of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that allowed of the
 germination and growth of that<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 60]</ph> tender plant we call LIFE. There are very tough
 living creatures, but the average organism is ill suited for violence. Most
 living creatures are adapted to mild temperatures and gentle reactions. Hence
 the fundamental importance of the early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal
 dust, in blanketing the earth against intensities of radiance from without,
 as Chamberlin says, and inequalities of radiance from within. This was the
 first preparation for life, but it was an atmosphere without free oxygen. Not
 less important was the appearance of pools and lakelets, of lakes and seas.
 Perhaps the early waters covered the earth. And water was the second
 preparation for life—water, that can dissolve a larger variety of
 substances in greater concentration than any other liquid; water, that in
 summer does not readily evaporate altogether from a pond, nor in winter
 freeze throughout its whole extent; water, that is such a mobile vehicle and
 such a subtle cleaver of substances; water, that forms over 80 per cent. of
 living matter itself.</p>
            <p>Of great significance was the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
 (in the form of carbonic acid and water) in the atmosphere of the cooling
 earth, for these three wonderful elements have a unique <i>ensemble</i> of
 properties—ready to enter into reactions and relations, making great
 diversity and complexity possible, favouring the formation of the plastic and
 permeable materials that build up living creatures. We must not pursue the
 idea, but it is clear that the stones and mortar of the inanimate world are
 such that they built a friendly home for life.</p>

   speck of greyish jelly, about 1/100th of an inch in diameter. It is
   commonly found gliding on the mud or weeds in ponds, where it engulfs its
   microscopic food by means of out-flowing lobes (PS). The food vacuole (FV)
   contains ingested food. From the contractile vacuole (CV) the waste matter
   is discharged. N is the nucleus, GR, granules.</p>

            </fig>
            <p>From ancient times it has been a favourite answer that the dust of the
 earth may have become living in a way which is outside scientific
 description. This answer forecloses the question, and it is far too soon to
 do that. Science must often say "Ignoramus": Science should be slow
 to say "Ignorabimus."</p>
            <p>A second position held by Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin, and others, suggests
 that minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere, in
 the cracks of a meteorite or among cosmic dust. It must be remembered that
 seeds can survive prolonged exposure to very low temperatures; that spores of
 bacteria can survive high temperature; that seeds of plants and germs of
 animals in a state of "latent life" can survive prolonged drought
 and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot, that as long
 as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities may be suspended
 for a time, and may afterwards recommence when appropriate conditions are
 restored. Therefore, one should be slow to say that a long journey through
 space is impossible. The obvious limitation of Lord Kelvin's theory is
 that it only shifts the problem of the origin of organisms (i.e. living
 creatures) from the earth to elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The third answer is that living creatures of a very simple sort may have
 emerged on the earth's surface from not-living material, e.g. from some
 semi-fluid carbon compounds activated by ferments. The tenability of this
 view is suggested by the achievements of the synthetic chemists, who are able
 artificially to build up substances such as oxalic acid, indigo, salicylic
 acid, caffeine, and grape-sugar. We do not know, indeed, what in Nature's
 laboratory would take the place of the clever synthetic chemist, but there
 seems to be a tendency to complexity. Corpuscles form atoms, atoms form
 molecules, small molecules large ones.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 62]</ph>
            </p>
            <p>Various concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible
 origin of living matter, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. So far
 as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of spontaneous
 generation; organisms seem always to arise from pre-existing organisms of the
 same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has been fancied, there have
 been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one thing to accept the verdict
 "omne vivum e vivo" as a fact to which experiment has not yet
 discovered an exception and another thing to maintain that this must always
 have been true or must always remain true.</p>
            <p>If the synthetic chemists should go on surpassing themselves, if
 substances like white of egg should be made artificially, and if we should
 get more light on possible steps by which simple living creatures may have
 arisen from not-living materials, this would not greatly affect our general
 outlook on life, though it would increase our appreciation of what is often
 libelled as "inert" matter. If the dust of the earth did naturally
 give rise very long ago to living creatures, if they are in a real sense born
 of her and of the sunshine, then the whole world becomes more continuous and
 more vital, and all the inorganic groaning and travailing becomes more
 intelligible.</p>

         <body>
            <p>We cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living
 creatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the earth. A
 basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest creatures
 living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled animalcules,
 especially those called Protists, which have not taken any very definite step
 towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can be sure, but there is
 much to be said for the theory that the first creatures were<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 63]</ph> microscopic
 globules of living matter, not unlike the simplest bacteria of to-day, but
 able to live on air, water, and dissolved salts. From such a source may have
 originated a race of one-celled marine organisms which were able to
 manufacture chlorophyll, or something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the
 green pigment which makes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the
 sunlight in breaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis)
 carbon compounds like sugars and starch. These little units were probably
 encased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed
 itself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of which
 they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There are many
 similar organisms to-day, mostly in water, but some of them—simple
 one-celled plants—paint the tree-stems and even the paving-stones green
 in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church there was a long chapter in
 the history of the earth when the sea that covered everything teemed with
 these green flagellates—the originators of the Vegetable Kingdom.</p>
            <p>On another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple
 predatory creatures, not able to build up organic matter from air, water, and
 salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not closed in with
 cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter or protoplasm flowing
 out in changeful processes, such as we see in the Amœbæ in the ditch or
 in our own white blood corpuscles and other amœboid cells. These were
 the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus from very simple Protists the
 first animals and the first plants may have arisen. All were still very
 minute, and it is worth remembering that had there been any scientific
 spectator after our kind upon the earth during these long ages, he would have
 lamented the entire absence of life, although the seas were teeming. The
 simplest forms of life and the protoplasm which Huxley called the physical
 basis of life will be dealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section
 of this work.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg

            <p>However it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the
 first great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the genealogical
 tree into Plants and Animals—the most important parting of the ways in
 the whole history of Nature.</p>
            <p>Typical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical
 level on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in their
 photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls, so that
 their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They manufacture
 much more nutritive material than they need, and live far below their income.
 They have no ready way of getting rid of any nitrogenous waste matter that
 they may form, and this probably helps to keep them sluggish.</p>
            <p>Animals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the
 carbohydrates (e.g. starch and sugar), fats, and proteins (e.g. gluten,
 albumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin with,
 by plants. Their cells have not cellulose walls, nor in most cases much wall
 of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted. Animals live much
 more nearly up to their income. If we could make for an animal and a plant of
 equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of the upbuilding, constructive,
 chemical processes to the down-breaking, disruptive, chemical processes that
 go on in their respective bodies, the ratio for the plant would be much
 greater than the corresponding ratio for the animal. In other words, animals
 take the munitions which plants laboriously manufacture and explode them in
 locomotion<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 65]</ph> and work; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon
 the photosynthesis that goes on in green plants.</p>

            <p>As the result of much more explosive life, animals have to deal with much
 in the way of nitrogenous waste products, the ashes of the living fire, but
 these are usually got rid of very effectively, e.g. in the kidney filters,
 and do not clog the system by being deposited as crystals and the like, as
 happens in plants. Sluggish animals like sea-squirts which have no kidneys
 are exceptions that prove the rule, and it need hardly be said that the
 statements that have been made in regard to the contrasts between plants and
 animals are general statements. There is often a good deal of the plant about
 the animal, as in sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and
 there is often a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the
 movements of all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts
 of the flower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the
 genealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there depended
 and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to speak of
 mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the human and animal
 population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen to the air we breathe,
 depend on the silent laboratories of the green leaves, which are able with
 the help of the sunlight to use carbonic acid, water, and salts to build up
 the bread of life.</p>

            <p>It is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth, and
 that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in the
 universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth's crust brought about
 elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the solid
 substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the floating plants
 to begin to settle down without getting out of the light. This is how
 Professor<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 66]</ph> Church pictures the beginning of a fixed vegetation—a
 very momentous step in evolution. It was perhaps among this early vegetation
 that animals had their first successes. As the floor of the sea in these
 shallow areas was raised higher and higher there was a beginning of dry land.
 The sedentary plants already spoken of were the ancestors of the shore
 seaweeds, and there is no doubt that when we go down at the lowest tide and
 wade cautiously out among the jungle of vegetation only exposed on such
 occasions we are getting a glimpse of very ancient days. <i>This</i> is the
 forest primeval.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>Animals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa. The
 word obviously means "First Animals," but all that we can say is
 that the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity of the
 original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast majority of the
 Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of as primitive. Though
 most of them are microscopic, each is an animal complete in itself, with the
 same fundamental bodily attributes as are manifested in ourselves. They
 differ from animals of higher degree in not being built up of the unit areas
 or corpuscles called cells. They have no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the
 ordinary acceptation of these words, but many of them show a great complexity
 of internal structure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up
 the tissues of higher animals. They are complete living creatures which have
 not gone in for body-making.</p>
            <p>In the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were of
 the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great steps in
 evolution was the establishment of three great types of Protozoa: (<i>a</i>)
 Some were very active, the Infusorians, like the slipper animalcule, the
 night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas phosphorescent at night, and
 the deadly Trypanosome, which causes Sleeping Sickness.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 67]</ph> (<i>b</i>) Others
 were very sluggish, the parasitic Sporozoa, like the malaria organism which
 the mosquito introduces into man's body. (<i>c</i>) Others were neither
 very active nor very passive, the Rhizopods, with out-flowing processes of
 living matter. This amœboid line of evolution has been very successful;
 it is represented by the Rhizopods, such as Amœbæ and the chalk-forming
 Foraminifera and the exquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the
 open sea. They have their counterparts in the amœboid cells of most
 multicellular animals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the
 body, engulfing and digesting intruding bacteria, serving as sappers and
 miners when something has to be broken down and built up again, and
 performing other useful offices.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>The great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in
 Organic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular animals
 (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago when sponges,
 stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and showed, for the first
 time, a "body." What would one not give to be able to account for
 the making of a body, one of the great steps in evolution! No one knows, but
 the problem is not altogether obscure.</p>
            <p>When an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or more,
 which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed float apart
 and live independent lives. But there are a few Protozoa in which the
 daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another, but remain
 coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some canals and the
 like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand cells. It has almost
 formed a body! But in this "colony-making" Protozoon, and in others
 like it, the component cells are all of one kind, whereas in true
 multicellular animals there are different kinds of<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 68]</ph> cells, showing
 division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in which the nucleus or
 kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell. This is seen in the Giant
 Amœba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in duck-ponds, or the beautiful
 Opalina, which always lives in the hind part of the frog's food-canal. If
 a portion of the living matter of these Protozoa should gather round each of
 the nuclei, then <i>that would be the beginning of a body</i>. It would be
 still nearer the beginning of a body if division of labour set in, and if
 there was a setting apart of egg-cells and sperm-cells distinct from
 body-cells.</p>
            <p>It was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body were
 first evolved. Two points should be noticed, that body-making is not
 essentially a matter of size, though it made large size possible. For the
 body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger than many a
 Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer—we are thinking of Hydatina—has nine
 hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in forms like
 Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that <i>every many-celled animal from
 sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary way begins at the beginning
 again as a "single cell,"</i> the fertilised egg-cell. It is, of
 course, not an ordinary single cell that develops into an earthworm or a
 butterfly, an eagle, or a man; it is a cell in which a rich inheritance, the
 fruition of ages, is somehow condensed; but it is interesting to bear in mind
 the elementary fact that every many-celled creature, reproduced in the
 ordinary way and not by budding or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell.
 The coherence of the daughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell
 divides is a reminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of
 daughter-units that made the first body possible.</p>

         <body>
            <p>A freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by budding.
 It forms daughter-buds, living images of itself; a check comes to nutrition
 and these daughter-buds go<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 69]</ph> free. A big sea-anemone may divide in two or
 more parts, which become separate animals. This is asexual reproduction,
 which means that the multiplication takes place by dividing into two or many
 portions, and not by liberating egg-cells and sperm-cells. Among animals as
 among plants, asexual reproduction is very common. But it has great
 disadvantages, for it is apt to be physiologically expensive, and it is beset
 with difficulties when the body shows great division of labour, and is very
 intimately bound into unity. Thus, no one can think of a bee or a bird
 multiplying by division or by budding. Moreover, if the body of the parent
 has suffered from injury or deterioration, the result of this is bound to be
 handed on to the next generation if asexual reproduction is the only
 method.</p>

            </fig>
            <p>Splitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of multiplying,
 but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery of a better method,
 namely, sexual reproduction. The gist of this is simply that during the
 process of body-building (by the development of the fertilised egg-cell)
 certain units, <i>the germ-cells</i>, do not share in forming ordinary
 tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the full inheritance which
 was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. <i>These cells kept by themselves
 are the originators of the future reproductive cells of the mature
 animal</i>; they give rise to the egg-cells and the sperm-cells.</p>
            <p>The advantages of this method are great. (1) The new generation is started
 less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the cradle of the
 water than to separate off half of the body. (2) It is possible to start a
 great many new lives at once, and this may be of vital importance when the
 struggle for existence is very keen, and when parental care is impossible.
 (3) The germ-cells are little likely to be prejudicially affected by
 disadvantageous dints impressed on the body of the parent—little likely
 unless the dints have peculiarly penetrating consequences, as in the case of
 poisons. (4) A further advantage is<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 70]</ph> implied in the formation of two kinds of
 germ-cells—the ovum or egg-cell, with a considerable amount of building
 material and often with a legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or
 sperm-cell, adapted to move in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance,
 thus securing change-provoking cross-fertilisation.</p>

         <body>
            <p>Another of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation of
 two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the female
 or egg-producer. It seems to be a deep-seated difference in constitution,
 which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another, lying beside it in
 the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it seems almost certain, from
 the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that there are two kinds of egg, a
 male-producing egg and a female-producing egg, which differ in their
 yolk-forming and other physiological characters.</p>
            <p>In sea-urchins we often find two creatures superficially
 indistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the other
 is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological difference does
 not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive organs or gonads only,
 though more intimate physiology would doubtless discover differences in the
 blood or in the chemical routine (metabolism). In a large number of cases,
 however, there are marked superficial differences between the sexes, and
 everyone is familiar with such contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and
 hind. In such cases the physiological difference between the sperm-producer
 and the ovum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates
 through the body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures
 and modes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine
 characters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical
 messengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs
 throughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 71]</ph> about the
 development of an antler or a wattle or a decorative plume or a capacity for
 vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the female
 carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are kept from
 expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the ovary. Of these
 chemical messengers more must be said later on.</p>
            <p>Recent research has shown that while the difference between male and
 female is very deep-rooted, corresponding to a difference in gearing, it is
 not always clear-cut. Thus a hen-pigeon may be very masculine, and a
 cock-pigeon very feminine. The difference is in degree, not in kind.</p>

            <ph outputclass="title-line">The Beginning of Natural Death</ph> 
         </title>
         <body>
            <p>There are three chief kinds of death, (<i>a</i>) The great majority of
 animals come to a violent end, being devoured by others or killed by sudden
 and extreme changes in their surroundings. (<i>b</i>) When an animal enters a
 new habitat, or comes into new associations with other organisms, it may be
 invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to which it is unaccustomed
 and to which it can offer no resistance. With many parasites a
 "live-and-let-live" compromise is arrived at, but new parasites are
 apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is bitten by a tse-tse fly
 which infects him with the microscopic animal (a Trypanosome) that causes
 Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the parasites are not troublesome as long
 as the host is vigorous,<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 72]</ph> but if the host is out of condition the
 parasites may get the upper hand, as in the so-called "grouse
 disease," and become fatal. (<i>c</i>) But besides violent death and
 microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death. This is in great part
 to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A body worth having implies
 complexity or division of labour, and this implies certain internal
 furnishings of a more or less stable kind in which the effects of wear and
 tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the living matter itself that grows old
 so much as the framework in which it works—the furnishings of the vital
 laboratory. There are various processes of rejuvenescence, e.g. rest, repair,
 change, reorganisation, which work against the inevitable processes of
 senescence, but sooner or later the victory is with ageing. Another deep
 reason for natural death is to be found in the physiological expensiveness of
 reproduction, for many animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death
 as the nemesis of starting new lives. Now it is a very striking fact that to
 a large degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural
 death. They are so relatively simple that they can continually recuperate by
 rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts. Moreover, their modes
 of multiplying, by dividing into two or many units, are very inexpensive
 physiologically. It seems that in some measure this bodily immortality of the
 Protozoa is shared by some simple many-celled animals like the freshwater
 Hydra and Planarian worms. Here is an interesting chapter in evolution, the
 evolution of means of evading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the
 well-known case of the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up
 in liberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice of
 the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.</p>
            <p>Along with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be
 considered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best suited
 to the welfare of the species, and the punctuation of the life-history to
 suit various conditions.</p>

   proportion to the other parts. In mammals it becomes more and more

         <body>
            <p>In animals like sea-anemones and jellyfishes the general symmetry of the
 body is radial; that is to say, there is no right or left, and the body might
 be halved along many planes. It is a kind of symmetry well suited for
 sedentary or for drifting life. But worms began the profitable habit of
 moving with one end of the body always in front, and from worms to man the
 great majority of animals have bilateral symmetry. They have a right and a
 left side, and there is only one cut that halves the body. This kind of
 symmetry is suited for a more strenuous life than radial animals show; it is
 suited for pursuing food, for avoiding enemies, for chasing mates. And
 <i>with the establishment of bilateral symmetry must be associated the
 establishment of head-brains</i>, the beginning of which is to be found in
 some simple worm-types.</p>
            <p>Among the other great acquisitions gradually evolved we may notice: a
 well-developed head with sense-organs, the establishment of large internal
 surfaces such as the digestive and absorptive wall of the food-canal, the
 origin of quickly contracting striped muscle and of muscular appendages, the
 formation of blood as a distributing medium throughout the body, from which
 all the parts take what they need and to which they also contribute.</p>
            <p>Another very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)
 to backboned animals, was the evolution of what are called glands of internal
 secretion, such as the thyroid and the supra-renal. These manufacture subtle
 chemical substances which are distributed by the blood throughout the body,
 and have a manifold influence in regulating and harmonising the vital
 processes. Some of these chemical messengers are called hormones, which
 stimulate organs and tissues to greater activity; others are called chalones,
 which put on a brake. Some regulate<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 74]</ph> growth and others rapidly alter the pressure
 and composition of the blood. Some of them call into active development
 certain parts of the body which have been, as it were, waiting for an
 appropriate trigger-pulling. Thus, at the proper time, the milk-glands of a
 mammalian mother are awakened from their dormancy. This very interesting
 outcome of evolution will be dealt with in another portion of this work.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>A human being begins as a microscopic fertilised egg-cell, within which
 there is condensed the long result of time—Man's inheritance. The
 long period of nine months before birth, with its intimate partnership
 between mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one can
 make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even after
 birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin with, there is
 in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all, and it develops very
 gradually from simple beginnings. Yet as mentality cannot come in from
 outside, we seem bound to conclude that the potentiality of it—whatever
 that means—resides in the individual from the very first. The
 particular kind of activity known to us as thinking, feeling, and willing is
 the most intimate part of our experience, known to us directly apart from our
 senses, and the possibility of that must be implicit in the germ-cell just as
 the genius of Newton was implicit in a very miserable specimen of an infant.
 Now what is true of the individual is true also of the race—there is a
 gradual evolution of that aspect of the living<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 75]</ph> creature's activity which we
 call mind. We cannot put our finger on any point and say: Before this stage
 there was no mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever
 there is life there is some degree of mind—even in the plants. Or it
 might be more accurate to put the conclusion in another way, that the
 activity we call life has always in some degree an inner or mental
 aspect.</p>

               <p>The Okapi is one of the great zoölogical discoveries. It
   gives a good idea of what the Giraffe's ancestors were like. The Okapi
   was unknown until discovered in 1900 by Sir Harry Johnston in Central
   Africa, where these strange animals have probably lived in dense forests
   from time immemorial.</p>

            </fig>
            <p>In another part of this book there is an account of the dawn of mind in
 backboned animals; what we aim at here is an outline of what may be called
 the inclined plane of animal behaviour.</p>
            <p>A very simple animal accumulates a little store of potential energy, and
 it proceeds to expend this, like an explosive, by acting on its environment.
 It does so in a very characteristic self-preservative fashion, so that it
 burns without being consumed and explodes without being blown to bits. It is
 characteristic of the organism that it remains a going concern for a longer
 or shorter period—its length of life. Living creatures that expended
 their energy ineffectively or self-destructively would be eliminated in the
 struggle for existence. When a simple one-celled organism explores a corner
 of the field seen under a microscope, behaving to all appearance very like a
 dog scouring a field seen through a telescope, it seems permissible to think
 of something corresponding to mental endeavour associated with its activity.
 This impression is strengthened when an amœba pursues another
 amœba, overtakes it, engulfs it, loses it, pursues it again, recaptures
 it, and so on. What is quite certain is that the behaviour of the animalcule
 is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a basin of water, nor
 like the lurching movements of a gun that has got loose and "taken
 charge" on board ship. Another feature is that the locomotor activity of
 an animalcule often shows a distinct individuality: it may swim, for
 instance, in a loose spiral.</p>
            <p>But there is another side to vital activity besides acting
 upon<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 76]</ph>
 the surrounding world; the living creature is acted on by influences from
 without. The organism acts on its environment; that is the one side of the
 shield: the environment acts upon the organism; that is the other side. If we
 are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of what we call
 living, and it is missing an important part of the history of animal life if
 we fail to see that evolution implies becoming more advantageously sensitive
 to the environment, making more of its influences, shutting out profitless
 stimuli, and opening more gateways to knowledge. The bird's world is a
 larger and finer world than an earthworm's; the world means more to the
 bird than to the worm.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>Simple creatures act with a certain degree of spontaneity on their
 environment, and they likewise react effectively to surrounding stimuli.
 Animals come to have definite "answers back," sometimes several,
 sometimes only one, as in the case of the Slipper Animalcule, which reverses
 its cilia when it comes within the sphere of some disturbing influence,
 retreats, and, turning upon itself tentatively, sets off again in the same
 general direction as before, but at an angle to the previous line. If it
 misses the disturbing influence, well and good; if it strikes it again, the
 tactics are repeated until a satisfactory way out is discovered or the
 stimulation proves fatal.</p>
            <p>It may be said that the Slipper Animalcule has but one answer to every
 question, but there are many Protozoa which have several enregistered
 reactions. When there are alternative reactions which are tried one after
 another, the animal is pursuing what is called the trial-and-error method,
 and a higher note is struck.</p>
            <p>There is an endeavour after satisfaction, and a trial of answers. When the
 creature profits by experience to the extent of giving the right answer
 first, there is the beginning of learning.</p>

         <body>
            <p>Among simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the
 beginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour of the
 lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in the animal in
 the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of nerve-cells and
 muscle-cells which secure that a fit and proper answer is given to a
 frequently recurrent stimulus. An earthworm half out of its burrow becomes
 aware of the light tread of a thrush's foot, and jerks itself back into
 its hole before anyone can say "reflex action." What is it that
 happens?</p>
            <p>Certain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm's skin are stimulated by
 vibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre from
 each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory fibres
 come into vital connection with branches of intermediary, associative, or
 communicating cells, which are likewise connected with motor nerve-cells. To
 these the message is thus shunted. From the motor nerve-cells an impulse or
 command travels by motor nerve-fibres, one from each cell, to the muscles,
 which contract. If this took as long to happen as it takes to describe, even
 in outline, it would not be of much use to the earthworm. But the motor
 answer follows the sensory stimulus almost instantaneously. The great
 advantage of establishing or enregistering these reflex chains is that the
 answers are practically ready-made or inborn, not requiring to be learned. It
 is not necessary that the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor
 does the animal will to act, though in certain cases it may by means of
 higher controlling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being
 given, as happens, for instance, when we control a cough or a sneeze on some
 solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the expression, has
 been to enregister ready-made responses; and as we ascend the animal kingdom,
 we find reflex actions becoming complicated and often linked together, so
 that the occurrence of one pulls the<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 78]</ph> trigger of another, and so on in a chain. The
 behaviour of the insectivorous plant called Venus's fly-trap when it
 shuts on an insect is like a reflex action in an animal, but plants have no
 definite nervous system.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>A somewhat higher level on the inclined plane is illustrated by what are
 called "tropisms," obligatory movements which the animal makes,
 adjusting its whole body so that physiological equilibrium results in
 relation to gravity, pressure, currents, moisture, heat, light, electricity,
 and surfaces of contact. A moth is flying past a candle; the eye next the
 light is more illumined than the other; a physiological inequilibrium
 results, affecting nerve-cells and muscle-cells; the outcome is that the moth
 automatically adjusts its flight so that both eyes become equally illumined;
 in doing this it often flies into the candle.</p>
            <p>It may seem bad business that the moth should fly into the candle, but the
 flame is an utterly artificial item in its environment to which no one can
 expect it to be adapted. These tropisms play an important rôle in animal
 behaviour.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>On a higher level is instinctive behaviour, which reaches such remarkable
 perfection in ants, bees, and wasps. In its typical expression instinctive
 behaviour depends on inborn capacities; it does not require to be learned; it
 is independent of practice or experience, though it may be improved by both;
 it is shared equally by all members of the species of the same sex (for the
 female's instincts are often different from the male's); it refers to
 particular conditions of life that are of vital importance, though they may
 occur only once in a lifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon
 when the Yucca flower puts forth its bell-like blossoms. She flies to a
 flower, collects<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 79]</ph> some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,
 and stows this away under her chin. She flies to an older Yucca flower and
 lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before she does
 so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From this the
 pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube fertilises the
 egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become real seeds, for it is
 only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has destroyed by using them as
 cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that the Yucca Moth has no individual
 experience of Yucca flowers, yet she secures the continuance of her race by a
 concatenation of actions which form part of her instinctive repertory.</p>
            <p>From a physiological point of view instinctive behaviour is like a chain
 of compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason to
 believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by
 endeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped
 routine is departed from to meet exceptional conditions. It should also be
 noted that just as ants, hive bees, and wasps exhibit in most cases purely
 instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of trial and
 error or of experimental initiative, so among birds and mammals the
 intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive routine. Perhaps
 there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of intelligence, and no
 intelligent behaviour without an instinctive element. The old view that
 instinctive behaviour was originally intelligent, and that instinct is
 "lapsed intelligence," is a tempting one, and is suggested by the
 way in which habitual intelligent actions cease in the individual to require
 intelligent control, but it rests on the unproved hypothesis that the
 acquisitions of the individual can be entailed on the race. It is almost
 certain that instinct is on a line of evolution quite different from
 intelligence, and that it is nearer to the inborn inspirations of the
 calculating boy or the musical genius than to the plodding methods of
 intelligent learning.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg

         <body>
            <p>The higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence in
 the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot be
 described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of
 perceptual inference, not only profiting by experience but learning by ideas.
 Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they are plastic
 and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection with instincts
 where routine cannot be departed from without the creature being nonplussed;
 they are not bound up with particular circumstances as instinctive actions
 are, but imply an appreciative awareness of relations.</p>
            <p>When there is an experimenting with general ideas, when there is
 <i>conceptual</i> as contrasted with <i>perceptual</i> inference, we speak of
 Reason, but there is no evidence of this below the level of man. It is not,
 indeed, always that we can credit man with rational conduct, but he has the
 possibility of it ever within his reach.</p>
            <p>Animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of
 this work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the
 evolution of behaviour. There is a main line of tentative experimental
 behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has been
 part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary enregistration
 of capacities of effective response, the advantages being that the answers
 come more rapidly and that the creature is left free, if it chooses, for
 higher adventures.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution
 animals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of behaviour,
 that they have become at once more controlled and more definitely free
 agents, and that the inner aspect of the behaviour—experimenting,
 learning, thinking, feeling, and willing—has come to count for more and
 more.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>Mammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which
 expresses itself at many levels—the tendency to bring forth the young
 at a well-advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated with
 a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish called
 <i>Luidia</i> which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year, and there are
 said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some other fishes.
 These illustrate the spawning method of solving the problem of survival. Some
 animals are naturally prolific, and the number of eggs which they sow
 broadcast in the waters allows for enormous infantile mortality and obviates
 any necessity for parental care.</p>
            <p>But some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an entirely
 different solution of the problem. They practise parental care and they
 secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a trend of
 evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So much so that
 Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size and frequency of
 the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of evolution to which the
 animal has attained.</p>
            <p>Now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the
 safety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young ones
 are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well advanced and
 more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the young a good
 send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly reduced. In other
 words, the animals that have varied in the direction of economised
 reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for existence if they
 have varied at the same time in the direction of parental care. In other
 cases it may have worked the other way round.</p>
            <p>In the interesting archaic animal called <i>Peripatus</i>, which
 has<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 82]</ph> to
 face a modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the
 environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many months
 within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature. There are only
 a few offspring at a time, and, although there are exceptional cases like the
 summer green-flies, which are very prolific though viviparous, the general
 rule is that viviparity is associated with a very small family. The case of
 flowering plants stands by itself, for although they illustrate a kind of
 viviparity, the seed being embryos, an individual plant may have a large
 number of flowers and therefore a huge family.</p>
            <p>Viviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial
 animals, where the risks to the young life are many, and it finds its climax
 among mammals.</p>
            <p>Now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the Duckmole
 and two Spiny Ant-eaters, lay eggs, i.e. are oviparous; that the Marsupials,
 on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were, prematurely, and in
 most cases stow them away in an external pouch; while all the
 others—the Placentals—show a more prolonged ante-natal life and
 an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn young.</p>
            <p outputclass="dim">§ 4</p>
            <p>There is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution. It
 has implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life; it has been a
 progressive conquest of the environment.</p>
            <p>1. It is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in the
 stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea—the shallow water,
 brightly illumined, seaweed-growing shelf fringing the Continents. This
 littoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water, earth
 and air all meet, where there is stimulating change, abundant oxygenation and
 a copious supply of nutritive material in what the streams bring down and in
 the rich seaweed vegetation.</p>

 surface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area.</p>
            <p>It is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no
 crowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for
 animals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating "sea-meadows" of
 microscopic Algæ. These are reincarnated in minute animals like the open-sea
 crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn making life
 possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and toothed whales. It is
 quite possible that the open sea was the original cradle of life and perhaps
 Professor Church is right in picturing a long period of pelagic life before
 there was any sufficiently shallow water to allow the floating plants to
 anchor. It is rather in favour of this view that many shore animals such as
 crabs and starfishes, spend their youthful stages in the relatively safe
 cradle of the open sea, and only return to the more strenuous conditions of
 their birthplace after they have gained considerable strength of body. It is
 probably safe to say that the honour of being the original cradle of life
 lies between the shore of the sea and the open sea.</p>

            <p>3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,
 which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a region
 of extreme cold—an eternal winter; of utter darkness—an eternal
 night—relieved only by the fitful gleams of "phosphorescent"
 animals; of enormous pressure—2½ tons on<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 84]</ph> the square inch at a depth of 2,500
 fathoms; of profound calm, unbroken silence, immense monotony. And as there
 are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one another,
 and, in the long run, on the rain of moribund animalcules which sink from the
 surface through the miles of water. It seems a very unpromising haunt of
 life, but it is abundantly tenanted, and it gives us a glimpse of the
 insurgent nature of the living creature that the difficulties of the Deep Sea
 should have been so effectively conquered. It is probable that the colonising
 of the great abysses took place in relatively recent times, for the fauna
 does not include many very antique types. It is practically certain that the
 colonisation was due to littoral animals which followed the food-débris,
 millennium after millennium, further and further down the long slope from the
 shore.</p>

 migration up estuaries and rivers, or by more direct passage from the
 seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some cases that
 partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually turned into
 freshwater basins. The animal population of the freshwaters is very
 representative, and is diversely adapted to meet the characteristic
 contingencies—the risk of being dried up, the risk of being frozen hard
 in winter, and the risk of being left high and dry after floods or of being
 swept down to the sea.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>5. The terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents
 from the sea or from the freshwaters. We must recognise the worm invasion,
 which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil, the invasion due to
 air-breathing Arthropods,<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 85]</ph> which led eventually to the important linkage
 between flowers and their insect visitors, and the invasion due to
 air-breathing Amphibians, which led eventually to the higher terrestrial
 animals and to the development of intelligence and family affection. Besides
 these three great invasions, there were minor ones such as that leading to
 land-snails, for there has been a widespread and persistent tendency among
 aquatic animals to try to possess the dry land.</p>
            <p>Getting on to dry land had a manifold significance.</p>
            <p>It implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen than
 there is dissolved in the water. But the oxygen of the air is more difficult
 to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well protected, as it is
 almost bound to become in animals living on dry ground. Thus this leads to
 the development of <i>internal surfaces</i>, such as those of lungs, where
 the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed by the blood. In most animals
 the blood goes to the surface of oxygen-capture; but in insects and their
 relatives there is a different idea—of taking the air to the blood or
 in greater part to the area of oxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A
 system of branching air-tubes takes air into every hole and corner of the
 insect's body, and this thorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret
 of the insect's intense activity. The blood never becomes impure.</p>
            <p>The conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of
 locomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed along by
 pressing a lever against a hard substratum. And it also followed that with
 few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal tended to be compact,
 readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or adjusted in some other way so
 that there may not be too large a surface trailing on the ground. An animal
 like a jellyfish, easily supported in the water, would be impossible on land.
 Such apparent exceptions as earthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not
 difficult to explain, for the earthworm<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 86]</ph> is a burrower which eats its way
 through the soil, the centipede's long body is supported by numerous hard
 legs, and the snake pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales
 to which the lower ends of very numerous ribs are attached.</p>

 Life</ph> 
         </title>
         <body>
            <p>A great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that
 locomotion becomes limited to one plane, namely, the surface of the earth.
 This is in great contrast to what is true in the water, where the animal can
 move up or down, to right or to left, at any angle and in three dimensions.
 It surely follows from this that the movements of land animals must be rapid
 and precise, unless, indeed, safety is secured in some other way. Hence it is
 easy to understand why most land animals have very finely developed striped
 muscles, and why a beetle running on the ground has far more numerous muscles
 than a lobster swimming in the sea.</p>
            <p>Land animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost,
 but these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the
 hairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals, from the carapace of
 tortoises to the armour of armadillos. In other cases, it is hardly necessary
 to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs meet the winter
 by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded retreat.</p>
            <p>Another consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young
 can no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is
 surrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the eggs
 were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are many that
 they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways in which land
 animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying them in the ground,
 or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them about for a prolonged period
 either before or after birth. This may mean great safety for the young, this
 may make it possible to have<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 87]</ph> only a small family, and this may tend to the
 evolution of parental care and the kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood
 that from the conquest of the land many far-reaching consequences have
 followed.</p>

 should have been colonised at all when the risks and difficulties are so
 great. The answer must be that necessity and curiosity are the mother and
 father of invention. Animals left the water because the pools dried up, or
 because they were overcrowded, or because of inveterate enemies, but also
 because of that curiosity and spirit of adventure which, from first to last,
 has been one of the spurs of progress.</p>

            <p>6. The last great haunt of life is the air, a mastery of which must be
 placed to the credit of insects, Pterodactyls, birds, and bats. These have
 been the successes, but it should be noted that there have been many
 brilliant failures, which have not attained to much more than parachuting.
 These include the Flying Fishes, which take leaps from the water and are
 carried for many yards and to considerable heights, holding their enlarged
 pectoral fins taut or with little more than a slight fluttering. There is a
 so-called Flying Frog (<i>Rhacophorus</i>) that skims from branch to branch,
 and the much more effective Flying Dragon (<i>Draco volans</i>) of the Far
 East, which has been mentioned already. Among mammals there are Flying
 Phalangers, Flying Lemurs, and more besides, all attaining to great skill as
 parachutists, and illustrating the endeavour to master the air which man has
 realised in a way of his own.</p>
            <p>The power of flight brings obvious advantages. A bird feeding<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 88]</ph> on the ground is
 able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into the air; food
 and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances; the eggs or the
 young can be placed in safe situations; and birds in their migrations have
 made a brilliant conquest both of time and space. Many of them know no winter
 in their year, and the migratory flight of the Pacific Golden Plover from
 Hawaii to Alaska and back again does not stand alone.</p>

            <p>How do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were
 established on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance and
 the succession of their advances? The answer is: by reading the Rock Record.
 In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated into
 continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the land has
 been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler hills and valleys.
 The high places of the land have been weathered by air and water in many
 forms, and the results of the weathering have been borne away by rivers and
 seas, to be laid down again elsewhere as deposits which eventually formed
 sandstones, mudstones, and similar sedimentary rocks. Much of the material of
 the original crust has thus been broken down and worked up again many times
 over, and if the total thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it
 amounts, according to some geologists, to a total of 67 miles. In most cases,
 however, only a small part of this thickness is to be seen in one place, for
 the deposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time.</p>

            <p>When the sediments were accumulating age after age, it naturally came
 about that remains of the plants and animals living<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 89]</ph> at the time were
 buried, and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible to
 read the story of the past. By careful piecing together of evidence the
 geologist is able to determine the order in which the different sedimentary
 rocks were laid down, and thus to say, for instance, that the Devonian period
 was the time of the origin of Amphibians. In other cases the geologist
 utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the order of the strata when
 these have been much disarranged. For the simpler fossil forms of any type
 must be older than those that are more complex. There is no vicious circle
 here, for the general succession of strata is clear, and it is quite certain
 that there were fishes before there were amphibians, and amphibians before
 there were reptiles, and reptiles before there were birds and mammals. In
 certain cases, e.g. of fossil horses and elephants, the actual historical
 succession has been clearly worked out.</p>
            <p>If the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and
 animals living at the time when the beds were formed, then it would be easy
 to read the record of the rocks, but many animals were too soft to become
 satisfactory fossils, many were eaten or dissolved away, many were destroyed
 by heat and pressure, so that the rock record is like a library very much
 damaged by fire and looting and decay.</p>

         <body>
            <p>The long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently divided
 into eras. Thus, just as we speak of the ancient, mediæval, and modern
 history of mankind, so we may speak of Palæozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras
 in the history of the earth as a whole.</p>
            <p>Geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the
 process of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how long
 has been required for the accumulation of<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 90]</ph> the salts of the sea, for all these
 have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to fall on the earth.
 Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is contributed every year
 in modern times, we get about a hundred million years as the age of the sea.
 But as the present rate of salt-accumulation is probably much greater than it
 was during many of the geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned
 is in all likelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how
 long it would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and
 mudstones, which have a <i>total</i> thickness of over fifty miles, though
 the <i>local</i> thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials
 have come from the weathering of the earth's crust, and as the annual
 amount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required for the
 formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be approximately
 calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell the earth's age
 and the length of the successive periods, but no certainty has been
 reached.</p>
            <p>The eras marked on the table (page 92) as <i>before the Cambrian</i>
 correspond to about thirty-two miles of thickness of strata; and all the
 subsequent eras with fossil-bearing rocks to a thickness of about twenty-one
 miles—in itself an astounding fact. Perhaps thirty million years must
 be allotted to the Pre-Cambrian eras, eighteen to the Palæozoic, nine to the
 Mesozoic, three to the Cenozoic, making a grand total of sixty millions.</p>

               <p>It can breathe oxygen dissolved in water by its gills; it
   can also breathe dry air by means of its swim-bladder, which has become a
   lung. It is a <i>double-breather</i>, showing evolution in process. For
   seven months of the year, the dry season, it can remain inert in the mud,
   getting air through an open pipe to the surface. When water fills the pools
   it can use its gills again. Mud-nests or mud encasements with the lung-fish
   inside have often been brought to Britain and the fish when liberated were
   quite lively.</p>

            <p>The rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to
 the fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build, but it must
 also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and repeatedly
 changed by pressure and heat, so that the traces which did exist would be
 very liable to obliteration. And if it be asked what right we have to suppose
 the presence of living creatures in the absence or extreme rarity of fossils,
 we must point to great accumulations of limestone which indicate the
 existence of calcareous algæ, and to deposits of iron which probably indicate
 the activity of iron-forming Bacteria. Ancient beds of graphite similarly
 suggest that green plants flourished in these ancient days.</p>

            <p>The <i>Cambrian</i> period was the time of the establishment of the chief
 stocks of backboneless animals such as sponges, jellyfishes, worms,
 sea-cucumbers, lamp-shells, trilobites, crustaceans, and molluscs. There is
 something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the seas had
 definitely begun some thirty million years ago, for Professor H. F. Osborn
 points out that in the Cambrian period there was already a colonisation of
 the shore of the sea, the open sea, and the deep waters.</p>
            <p>The <i>Ordovician</i> period was marked by abundant representation of the
 once very successful class of Trilobites—jointed-footed,
 antenna-bearing, segmented marine animals, with numerous appendages and a
 covering of chitin. They died away entirely with the end of the Palæozoic
 era. Also very notable was the abundance of predatory cuttlefishes, the
 bullies of the ancient seas. But it was in this period that the first
 backboned animals made their appearance—an epoch-making step in
 evolution. In other words, true fishes were evolved—destined in the
 course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes (which are mere molluscs) in
 dominating the seas.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg

 apace, there was the first known attempt at colonising the dry land. For in
 Silurian rocks there are fossil scorpions, and that implies ability to
 breathe dry air—by means of internal surfaces, in this case known as
 lungbooks. It was also towards the end of the Silurian, when a period of
 great aridity set in, that fishes appeared related to our mud-fishes or
 double-breathers (Dipnoi), which have lungs as well as gills. This, again,
 meant utilising dry air, just as the present-day mud-fishes do when the water
 disappears from the pools in hot weather. The lung-fishes or mud-fishes of
 to-day are but three in number, one in Queensland, one in South America, and
 one in Africa, but they are extremely<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 93]</ph> interesting "living fossils,"
 binding the class of fishes to that of amphibians. It is highly probable that
 the first invasion of the dry land should be put to the credit of some
 adventurous worms, but the second great invasion was certainly due to
 air-breathing Arthropods, like the pioneer scorpion we mentioned.</p>

 the Devonian foot-print of <i>Thinopus</i>, the first known Amphibian
 foot-print—an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of the dry
 land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that the first
 Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that they came to
 their own. While they were still feeling their way, there was a remarkable
 exuberance of shark-like and heavily armoured fishes in the Devonian
 seas.</p>

            <p>The <i>Carboniferous</i> period was marked by a mild moist climate and a
 luxuriant vegetation in the swampy low grounds. It was a much less strenuous
 time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer. There were no
 trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of club-mosses and
 horsetails which grew to a gigantic size compared with their pigmy
 representatives of to-day. In these forests the jointed-footed invaders of
 the dry land ran riot in the form of centipedes, spiders, scorpions, and
 insects, and on these the primeval Amphibians fed. The appearance of insects
 made possible a new linkage of far-reaching importance, namely, the
 cross-fertilisation of flowering plants by their insect visitors, and from
 this time onwards it may be said that flowers and their visitors have evolved
 hand in hand.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 94]</ph> Cross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind,
 and cross-fertilisation is more advantageous than self-fertilisation because
 it promotes both fertility and plasticity. It was probably in this period
 that <i>coloured</i> flowers—attractive to insect-visitors—began
 to justify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the
 monotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered great
 tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous forests there
 were also land-snails, representing one of the minor invasions of the dry
 land, tending on the whole to check vegetation. They, too, were probably
 preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which attained a large size. Each age
 has had its giants, and those of the Carboniferous were Amphibians called
 Labyrinthodonts, some of which were almost as big as donkeys. It need hardly
 be said that it was in this period that most of the Coal-measures were laid
 down by the immense accumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss
 forests. Ages afterwards, it was given to man to tap this great source of
 energy—traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even
 then it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>As Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may
 fitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which the
 emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage from
 water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful life,
 taxed no doubt by increased difficulties. The natural question rises why
 animals should have migrated from water to dry land at all when great
 difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers must be: (<i>a</i>)
 that local drying up of water-basins or elevations of the land surface often
 made the old haunts untenable; (<i>b</i>) that there may have been great
 congestion and competition in the old quarters; and (<i>c</i>) that there has
 been an undeniable endeavour<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 95]</ph> after well-being throughout the history of
 animal life. In the same way with mankind, migrations were prompted by the
 setting in of prolonged drought, by over-population, and by the spirit of
 adventure. (2) In Amphibians for the first time the non-digitate paired fins
 of fishes were replaced by limbs with fingers and toes. This implied an
 advantageous power of grasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the
 mouth, of feeling things in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in
 regard to the soft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but
 if they were in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders
 of the present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the
 following: true ventral lungs, a three-chambered heart, a movable tongue, a
 drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting to find that
 though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in it, they are not
 strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue of fishes, which has
 not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole becomes a frog, the
 muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible for the full-grown
 creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This is probably a
 recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of millennia in the
 history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition made by Amphibians was
 a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid passage of air over taut
 membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the larynx. It is an interesting fact
 that for millions of years there was upon the earth no sound of life at all,
 only the noise of wind and wave, thunder and avalanche. Apart from the
 instrumental music of some insects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous,
 the first vital sounds were due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the
 first voice—surely one of the great steps in organic evolution.</p>

            <p>The first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and
 toads—it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 96]</ph> of the trumpeting
 with which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males that
 the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past Amphibians
 altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call helping to secure the
 safety of the young—a use very obvious when young birds squat
 motionless at the sound of the parent's danger-note. Later on, probably,
 the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched crocodile pipes
 from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the mother that it is time
 to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses emotion, as in the song of
 birds, often outside the limits of the breeding time. Later still, particular
 sounds become words, signifying particular things or feelings, such as
 "food," "danger," "home," "anger,"
 and "joy." Finally words become a medium of social intercourse and
 as symbols help to make it possible for man to reason.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>In the <i>Permian</i> period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,
 began to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of
 backboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method of
 breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages at least.
 The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a vascular hood spread
 underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from without. It is an
 interesting point that this vascular hood, called the allantois, is
 represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder growing out from the
 hind end of the food-canal. A great step in evolution was implied in the
 origin of this ante-natal hood or fœtal membrane and another
 one—of protective significance—called the amnion, which forms a
 water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total emancipation from
 the water and from gill-breathing, and the two fœtal membranes, the
 amnion and the allantois, persist not only in all reptiles but in birds
 and<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 97]</ph>
 mammals as well. These higher Vertebrates are therefore called Amniota in
 contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or Anamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and
 primitive types).</p>
            <p>It is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and
 mammals show gill-clefts—<i>a tell-tale evidence of their distant
 aquatic ancestry</i>. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for
 respiration and show no trace of gills except in a few embryonic reptiles and
 birds where their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the
 gill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the first
 becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the back of the
 mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any use, and that in a
 transformed guise, would be difficult to interpret except in terms of the
 Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering influence of a long pedigree,
 the living hand of the past, the tendency that individual development has to
 recapitulate racial evolution. In a condensed and telescoped manner, of
 course, for what took the race a million years may be recapitulated by the
 individual in a week!</p>
            <p>In the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the Carboniferous
 period was replaced by severe conditions, culminating in an Ice Age which
 spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the world. With this was
 associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and the appearance of a new
 one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and cycads, which persisted
 until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The Permian Ice Age lasted for
 millions of years, and was most severe in the Far South. Of course, it was a
 very different world then, for North Europe was joined to North America,
 Africa to South America, and Australia to Asia. It was probably during the
 Permian Ice Age that many of the insects divided their life-history into two
 main chapters—the feeding, growing, moulting, immature, larval stages,
 e.g. caterpillars, and the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged
 phase, adapted for reproduction. Between<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 98]</ph> these there intervened the
 quiescent, well-protected pupa stage or chrysalis, probably adapted to begin
 with as a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an
 animal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>We cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged ice
 age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large number of
 ancient types, especially among plants and backboneless animals, which now
 disappear for ever. It is necessary to understand that the animals of ancient
 days stand in three different relations to those of to-day. (<i>a</i>) There
 are ancient types that have living representatives, sometimes few and
 sometimes many, sometimes much changed and sometimes but slightly changed.
 The lamp-shell, <i>Lingulella</i>, of the Cambrian and Ordovician period has
 a very near relative in the <i>Lingula</i> of to-day. There are a few
 extremely conservative animals. (<i>b</i>) There are ancient types which have
 no living representatives, except in the guise of transformed descendants, as
 the King-crab (<i>Limulus</i>) may be said to be a transformed descendant of
 the otherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions
 belonged. (<i>c</i>) There are altogether extinct types—<i>lost
 races</i>—which have left not a wrack behind. For there is not any
 representation to-day of such races as Graptolites and Trilobites.</p>
            <p>Looking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the
 Palæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There was
 in the <i>Cambrian</i> the establishment of the chief classes of backboneless
 animals; in the <i>Ordovician</i> the first fishes and perhaps the first
 terrestrial plants; in the <i>Silurian</i> the emergence of air-breathing
 Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the <i>Devonian</i> the appearance of the
 first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals are descended, and the
 establishment of a land flora; in the <i>Carboniferous</i> the great
 Club-moss forests<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 99]</ph> and an exuberance of air-breathing insects and their allies;
 in the <i>Permian</i> the first reptiles and a new flora.</p>

            <p>In a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of
 reptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was
 established in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern
 flowering plants were beginning to show face tentatively, just like birds and
 mammals among the great reptiles.</p>
            <p>In the <i>Triassic</i> period the exuberance of reptilian life which
 marked the Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there
 were Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, none of which
 lasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the
 Dinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the limits
 of this vigorous and plastic stock—some of them bipeds—we must
 look for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water were
 dominated by reptiles, some of which attained to gigantic size. Had there
 been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very sagacious indeed if
 he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the climax of creation.</p>

         <body>
            <p>The <i>Jurassic</i> period showed a continuance of the reptilian
 splendour. They radiated in many directions, becoming adapted to many haunts.
 Thus there were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of
 terrestrial dragons stalking about on land, many swiftly gliding
 alligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic
 attained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the
 extension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated
 outermost<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 100]</ph> finger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a
 spread of over five feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying
 Birds was an adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is
 not more than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that
 they could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of
 flight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of the
 keel, which is simply a great ridge for the better insertion of the muscles
 of flight. It is absent, of course, in the Running Birds, like the ostrich,
 and it has degenerated in an interesting way in the burrowing parrot
 (<i>Stringops</i>) and a few other birds that have "gone back."</p>

         <body>
            <p>But the Jurassic is particularly memorable because its strata have yielded
 two fine specimens of the first known bird, <i>Archæopteryx</i>. These were
 entombed in the deposits which formed the fine-grained lithographic stones of
 Bavaria, and practically every bone in the body is preserved except the
 breast-bone. Even the feathers have left their marks with distinctness. This
 oldest known bird—too far advanced to be the first bird—was about
 the size of a crow and was probably of arboreal habits. Of great interest are
 its reptilian features, so pronounced that one cannot evade the evolutionist
 suggestion. It had teeth in both jaws, which no modern bird has; it had a
 long lizard-like tail, which no modern bird has; it had claws on three
 fingers, and a sort of half-made wing. That is to say, it does not show, what
 all modern birds show, a fusion of half the wrist-bones with the whole of the
 palm-bones, the well-known carpo-metacarpus bone which forms a basis for the
 longest pinions. In many reptiles, such as Crocodiles, there are peculiar
 bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the so-called
 "abdominal ribs," and it seems an eloquent detail to find these
 represented in <i>Archæopteryx</i>, the earliest known bird. No modern bird
 shows any trace of them.</p>

            <p>There is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or Pterodactyls
 gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different lines, and the
 structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the long-fingered
 Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of the bird's
 wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable that birds evolved
 from certain Dinosaurs which had become bipeds, and it is possible that they
 were for a time swift runners that took "flying jumps" along the
 ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal apprenticeship during
 which there was much gliding from tree to tree before true flight was
 achieved. It is an interesting fact that the problem of flight has been
 solved four times among animals—by insects, by Pterodactyls, by birds,
 and by bats; and that the four solutions are on entirely different lines.</p>
            <p>In the <i>Cretaceous</i> period the outstanding events included the waning
 of giant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the
 multiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as the
 dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was probably
 from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic. Comparatively
 little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that their back-teeth were
 marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but they were gaining strength in
 the late Triassic when small arboreal insectivores, not very distant from the
 modern tree-shrews (<i>Tupaia</i>), began to branch out in many directions
 indicative of the great divisions of modern mammals, such as the clawed
 mammals, hoofed mammals, and the race of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper
 Cretaceous there was an exuberant "radiation" of mammals, adaptive
 to the conquest of all sorts of haunts, and this was vigorously continued in
 Tertiary times.</p>
            <p>There is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite
 mammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic. For
 although we usually rank mammals as higher than birds (being mammals
 ourselves, how could we do<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 102]</ph> otherwise?), there are many ways in which
 birds are pre-eminent, e.g. in skeleton, musculature, integumentary
 structures, and respiratory system. The fact is that birds and mammals are on
 two quite different tacks of evolution, not related to one another, save in
 having a common ancestry in extinct reptiles. Moreover, there is no reason to
 believe that the Jurassic <i>Archæopteryx</i> was the first bird in any sense
 except that it is the first of which we have any record. In any case it is
 safe to say that birds came to their own before mammals did.</p>
            <p>Looking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the
 Mesozoic era in Professor Schuchert's sentence: "The Mesozoic is the
 Age of Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are storing
 up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the cycads and
 conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants."</p>

            <p>In the <i>Eocene</i> period there was a replacement of the small-brained
 archaic mammals by big-brained modernised types, and with this must be
 associated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry pasture.
 Marshes were replaced by meadows and browsing by grazing mammals. In the
 spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a richer evolution of
 insects and birds.</p>
            <p>During the <i>Oligocene</i> the elevation of the land continued, the
 climate became much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their
 range.</p>
            <p>The <i>Miocene</i> was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning
 examples of what Osborn calls "adaptive radiation." That is to say,
 mammals, like the reptiles before them, conquer every haunt of life. There
 are flying bats, volplaning parachutists, climbers in trees like sloths and
 squirrels, quickly moving hoofed mammals, burrowers like the moles,
 freshwater<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 103]</ph> mammals, like duckmole and beaver, shore-frequenting seals
 and manatees, and open-sea cetaceans, some of which dive far more than full
 fathoms five. It is important to realise the perennial tendency of animals to
 conquer every corner and to fill every niche of opportunity, and to notice
 that this has been done by successive sets of animals in succeeding ages.
 <i>Most notably the mammals repeat all the experiments of reptiles on a
 higher turn of the spiral.</i> Thus arises what is called convergence, the
 superficial resemblance of unrelated types, like whales and fishes, the
 resemblance being due to the fact that the different types are similarly
 adapted to similar conditions of life. Professor H. F. Osborn points out that
 mammals may seek any one of the twelve different habitat-zones, and that in
 each of these there may be six quite different kinds of food. Living
 creatures penetrate everywhere like the overflowing waters of a great river
 in flood.</p>
            <p outputclass="dim">§ 3</p>
            <p>The <i>Pliocene</i> period was a more strenuous time, with less genial
 climatic conditions, and with more intense competition. Old land bridges were
 broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution underwent great
 changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the <i>Pliocene</i> as "a period
 of great unrest." "Many migrations occurred the world over, new
 competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects of the
 strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the Pliocene,
 and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity into
 man—the culmination of the highest line of evolution."</p>
            <p>The <i>Pleistocene</i> period was a time of sifting. There was a continued
 elevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by less
 severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards for a
 time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the sabre-toothed
 tiger, the cave-lion,<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 104]</ph> and the cave-bear, became extinct. Others
 which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far North or were
 left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like the Snow Mouse,
 which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the snow-line. Perhaps it
 was during this period that many birds of the Northern Hemisphere learned to
 evade the winter by the sublime device of migration.</p>
            <p>Looking backwards we may quote Professor Schuchert again:</p>
            <lq>
               <p>"The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more
  flowering plants and grand hardwood forests, the atmosphere is scented with
  sweet odours, a vast crowd of new kinds of insects appear, and the places of
  the once dominant reptiles of the lands and seas are taken by the mammals.
  Out of these struggles there rises a greater intelligence, seen in nearly
  all of the mammal stocks, but particularly in one, the monkey-ape-man. Brute
  man appears on the scene with the introduction of the last glacial climate,
  a most trying time for all things endowed with life, and finally there
  results the dominance of reasoning man over all his brute
  associates."</p>

            <p>But in spite of man's undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to
 his solidarity with the rest of creation. There is an "all-pervading
 similitude of structure," between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it
 is certain that it is not from any living form that he took his origin. None
 of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be called
 momentous. Man's body is a veritable museum of relics (vestigial
 structures) inherited from pre-human ancestors. In his everyday bodily life
 and in some of its disturbances, man's pedigree is often revealed. Even
 his facial expression, as Darwin showed, is not always human. Some fossil
 remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.</p>
            <p>It is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of
 Darwin's <i>Descent of Man</i>:</p>
            <lq>
               <p>"We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man, with
  all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased,
  with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest
  living creature, with his God-like intellect which has penetrated into the
  movements and constitution of the solar system—with all these exalted
  powers—man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his
  lowly origin."</p>

      <body>
         <p>There is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often overlooked,
 the tendency to link lives together in vital inter-relations. Thus flowers
 and their insect visitors are often vitally interlinked in mutual dependence.
 Many birds feed on berries and distribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater
 snail is the host of<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 106]</ph> the juvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the
 sheep. The mosquito is the vehicle of malaria from man to man, and the
 tse-tse fly spreads sleeping sickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue
 its race without the unconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the
 freshwater fish called the bitterling cannot continue its race without the
 unconscious co-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually
 beneficial partnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other
 inter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of insects
 that make galls on plants. There are also among kindred animals many forms of
 colonies, communities, and societies. Nutritive chains bind long series of
 animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the whelk on the worm, the
 worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a system of successive
 incarnations and matter is continually passing from one embodiment to
 another. These instances must suffice to illustrate the central biological
 idea of the web of life, the interlinked System of Animate Nature. Linnæus
 spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the orderly hierarchy of classes,
 orders, families, genera, and species; but we owe to Darwin in particular
 some knowledge of a more dynamic Systema Naturæ, the network of vital
 inter-relations. This has become more and more complex as evolution has
 continued, and man's web is most complex of all. It means making Animate
 Nature more of a unity; it means an external method of registering steps of
 progress; it means an evolving set of sieves by which new variations are
 sifted, and living creatures are kept from slipping down the steep ladder of
 evolution.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>It sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one
 living creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the case
 with many thoroughgoing internal parasites which have sunk into an easygoing
 kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food, requiring no
 exertions, running<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 107]</ph> no risks, and receiving no spur to effort. Thus we see that
 evolution is not necessarily progressive; everything depends on the
 conditions in reference to which the living creatures have been evolved. When
 the conditions are too easygoing, the animal may be thoroughly well adapted
 to them—as a tapeworm certainly is—but it slips down the rungs of
 the ladder of evolution.</p>
            <p>This is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution—the
 establishment of different kinds of parasites, casual and constant, temporary
 and lifelong, external hangers-on and internal unpaying boarders, those that
 live in the food-canal and depend on the host's food and those that
 inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food there. It seems clear
 that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch inside a caterpillar and eat it
 alive are not so much parasites as "beasts of prey" working from
 within.</p>
            <p>But there are two sides to this minor chapter: there is the evolution of
 the parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures on
 the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of
 wandering amœboid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body
 and often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there is
 the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic substances or
 "anti-bodies" which counteract poisons, including the poisons which
 the intruding parasites often make.</p>

         <body>
            <p>There has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of
 evolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For millions of
 years Life has been slowly creeping upwards, and if we compare the highest
 animals—Birds and Mammals—with their predecessors, we must admit
 that they<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 108]</ph> are more controlled, more masters of their fate, with more
 mentality. Evolution is on the whole <i>integrative</i>; that is to say, it
 makes against instability and disorder, and towards harmony and progress.
 Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can discern that the evolutionary
 process was making towards a fuller embodiment or expression of what Man
 values most—control, freedom, understanding, and love. The advance of
 animal life through the ages has been chequered, but on the whole it has been
 an advance towards increasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the
 study of this advance—the central fact of Organic Evolution—there
 is assuredly much for Man's instruction and much for his
 encouragement.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>In all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for
 granted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly answered
 that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of the past and the
 parent of the future, cannot be <i>proved</i> as one may prove the Law of
 Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is a key—a way of
 looking at things—that fits the facts. There is no lock that it does
 not open.</p>
            <p>But if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called
 the evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is
 <i>historical</i> evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact
 that fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and these
 before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil series, e.g.
 among cuttlefishes, in which we can almost see evolution in process. The
 pedigree of horse and elephant and crocodile is in general very convincing,
 though it is to be confessed that there are other cases in regard to which we
 have no light. Who can tell, for instance, how Vertebrates arose or from what
 origin?</p>
            <p>There is <i>embryological</i> evidence, for the individual
 development<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 109]</ph> often reads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the
 presumed evolution of the race. The mammal's visceral clefts are
 tell-tale evidence of remote aquatic ancestors, breathing by gills. Something
 is known in regard to the historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the
 Red Deer of to-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the
 history. The individual development of an asymmetrical flat-fish, like a
 plaice or sole, which rests and swims on one side, tells us plainly that its
 ancestors were symmetrical fishes.</p>
            <p>There is what might be called <i>physiological</i> evidence, for many
 plants and animals are variable before our eyes, and evolution is going on
 around us to-day. This is familiarly seen among domesticated animals and
 cultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need hardly
 be said that some organisms are very conservative, and that change need not
 be expected when a position of stable equilibrium has been secured.</p>
            <p>There is also <i>anatomical</i> evidence of a most convincing quality. In
 the fore-limbs of backboned animals, say, the paddle of a turtle, the wing of
 a bird, the flipper of a whale, the fore-leg of a horse, and the arm of a
 man; the same essential bones and muscles are used to such diverse results!
 What could it mean save blood relationship? And as to the two sets of teeth
 in whalebone whales, which never even cut the gum, is there any alternative
 but to regard them as relics of useful teeth which ancestral forms possessed?
 In short, the evolution theory is justified by the way in which it works.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>If it be said "So much for the <i>fact</i> of evolution, but what of
 the <i>factors</i>?" the answer is not easy. For not only is the problem
 the greatest of all scientific problems, but the inquiry is still very young.
 The scientific study of evolution<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 110]</ph> practically dates from the publication of
 <i>The Origin of Species</i> in 1859.</p>
            <p>Heritable novelties or variations often crop up in living creatures, and
 these form the raw material of evolution. These variations are the outcome of
 expression of changes in the germ-cells that develop into organisms. But why
 should there be changes in the constitution of the germ-cells? Perhaps
 because the living material is very complex and inherently liable to change;
 perhaps because it is the vehicle of a multitude of hereditary items among
 which there are very likely to be reshufflings or rearrangements; perhaps
 because the germ-cells have very changeful surroundings (the blood, the
 body-cavity fluid, the sea-water); perhaps because deeply saturating outside
 influences, such as change of climate and habitat, penetrate through the body
 to its germ-cells and provoke them to vary. But we must be patient with the
 wearisome reiteration of "perhaps." Moreover, every many-celled
 organism reproduced in the usual way, arises from an egg-cell fertilised by a
 sperm-cell, and the changes involved in and preparatory to this fertilisation
 may make new permutations and combinations of the living items and hereditary
 qualities not only possible but necessary. It is something like shuffling a
 pack of cards, but the cards are living. As to the changes wrought on the
 body during its lifetime by peculiarities in nurture, habits, and
 surroundings, these dents or modifications are often very important for the
 individual, but it does not follow that they are directly important for the
 race, since it is not certain that they are transmissible.</p>
            <p>Given a crop of variations or new departures or mutations, whatever the
 inborn novelties may be called, we have then to inquire how these are sifted.
 The sifting, which means the elimination of the relatively less fit
 variations and the selection of the relatively more fit, effected in many
 different ways in the course of the struggle for existence. The organism
 plays its new card in the game of life, and the consequences may
 determine<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 111]</ph> survival. The relatively less fit to given conditions will
 tend to be eliminated, while the relatively more fit will tend to survive. If
 the variations are hereditary and reappear, perhaps increased in amount,
 generation after generation, and if the process of sifting continue
 consistently, the result will be the evolution of the species. The sifting
 process may be helped by various forms of "isolation" which lessen
 the range of free intercrossing between members of a species, e.g. by
 geographical barriers. Interbreeding of similar forms tends to make a stable
 stock; out-breeding among dissimilars tends to promote variability. But for
 an outline like this it is enough to suggest the general method of organic
 evolution: Throughout the ages organisms have been making
 tentatives—new departures of varying magnitude—and these
 tentatives have been tested. The method is that of testing all things and
 holding fast that which is good.</p>
