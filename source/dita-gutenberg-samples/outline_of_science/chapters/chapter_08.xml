      </title>
      <body>
         <p>In the story of evolution there is no chapter more interesting than the
 emergence of mind in the animal kingdom. But it is a difficult chapter to
 read, partly because "mind" cannot be seen or measured, only
 <i>inferred</i> from the outward behaviour of the creature, and partly
 because it is almost impossible to avoid reading ourselves into the much
 simpler animals.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>The one extreme is that of uncritical generosity which credits every
 animal, like Brer Rabbit—who, by the way, was the hare—with human
 qualities. The other extreme is that of thinking of the animal as if it were
 an automatic machine, in the working of which there is no place or use for
 mind. Both these extremes are to be avoided.</p>
            <p>When Professor Whitman took the eggs of the Passenger Pigeon (which became
 extinct not long ago with startling rapidity) and placed them a few inches to
 one side of the nest, the bird looked a little uneasy and put her beak under
 her body as if to feel for something that was not there. But she did not try
 to retrieve her eggs, close at hand as they were. In a short time she flew
 away altogether. This shows that the mind of the pigeon is in some respects
 very different from the mind of man. On the other hand, when a certain clever
 dog, carrying a basket of eggs, with the handle in his mouth, came to a stile
 which had to be negotiated, he laid the basket on the ground, pushed it
 gently through a low gap to the other side, and then took a running leap
 over. We dare not talk of this dog as an automatic machine.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 208]</ph>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>In studying the behaviour of animals, which is the only way of getting at
 their mind, for it is only of our own mind that we have direct knowledge, it
 is essential to give prominence to the fact that there has been throughout
 the evolution of living creatures a strong tendency to enregister or engrain
 capacities of doing things effectively. Thus certain abilities come to be
 inborn; they are parts of the inheritance, which will express themselves
 whenever the appropriate trigger is pulled. The newly born child does not
 require to learn its breathing movements, as it afterwards requires to learn
 its walking movements. The ability to go through the breathing movements is
 inborn, engrained, enregistered.</p>
            <p>In other words, there are hereditary pre-arrangements of nerve-cells and
 muscle-cells which come into activity almost as easily as the beating of the
 heart. In a minute or two the newborn pigling creeps close to its mother and
 sucks milk. It has not to learn how to do this any more than we have to learn
 to cough or sneeze. Thus animals have many useful ready-made, or almost
 ready-made, capacities of doing apparently clever things. In simple cases of
 these inborn pre-arrangements we speak of reflex actions; in more complicated
 cases, of instinctive behaviour. Now the caution is this, that while these
 inborn capacities usually work well in natural conditions, they sometimes
 work badly when the ordinary routine is disturbed. We see this when a pigeon
 continues sitting for many days on an empty nest, or when it fails to
 retrieve its eggs only two inches away. But it would be a mistake to call the
 pigeon, because of this, an unutterably stupid bird. We have only to think of
 the achievements of homing pigeons to know that this cannot be true. We must
 not judge animals in regard to those kinds of behaviour which have been
 handed over to instinct, and go badly agee when the normal routine is
 disturbed. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the enregistered instinctive
 capacities work well, and the advantage of<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 209]</ph> their becoming stereotyped was
 to leave the animal more free for adventures at a higher level. Being "a
 slave of instinct" may give the animal a security that enables it to
 discover some new home or new food or new joy. Somewhat in the same way, a
 man of methodical habits, which he has himself established, may gain leisure
 to make some new departure of racial profit.</p>

            </fig>
            <p>When we draw back our finger from something very hot, or shut our eye to
 avoid a blow from a rebounding branch, we do not will the action; and this is
 more or less the case, probably, when a young mammal sucks its mother for the
 first time. Some Mound-birds of Celebes lay their eggs in warm volcanic ash
 by the shore of the sea, others in a great mass of fermenting vegetation; it
 is inborn in the newly hatched bird to struggle out as quickly as it can from
 such a strange nest, else it will suffocate. If it stops struggling too soon,
 it perishes, for it seems that the trigger of the instinct cannot be pulled
 twice. Similarly, when the eggs of the turtle, that have been laid in the
 sand of the shore, hatch out, the young ones make <i>instinctively</i> for
 the sea. Some of the crocodiles bury their eggs two feet or so below the
 surface among sand and decaying vegetation—an awkward situation for a
 birthplace. When the young crocodile is ready to break out of the egg-shell,
 just as a chick does at the end of the three weeks of brooding, it utters
 <i>instinctively</i> a piping cry. On hearing this, the watchful mother digs
 away the heavy blankets, otherwise the young crocodile would be buried alive
 at birth. Now there is no warrant for believing that the young Mound-birds,
 young crocodiles, and young turtles have an intelligent appreciation of what
 they do when they are hatched. They act instinctively, "as to the manner
 born." But this is not to say that their activity is not backed by
 endeavour or even suffused with a certain amount of awareness. Of course, it
 is necessarily difficult for man, who is so much a creature of intelligence,
 to get even an inkling of the mental side of instinctive behaviour.</p>
            <p>In many of the higher reaches of animal instinct, as in
 courtship<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 210]</ph> or nest-building, in hunting or preparing the food, it looks
 as if the starting of the routine activity also "rang up" the
 higher centres of the brain and put the intelligence on the <i>qui vive</i>,
 ready to interpose when needed. So the twofold caution is this: (1) We must
 not depreciate the creature too much if, in unusual circumstances, it acts in
 an ineffective way along lines of behaviour which are normally handed over to
 instinct; and (2) we must leave open the possibility that even routine
 instinctive behaviour may be suffused with awareness and backed by
 endeavour.</p>

         <body>
            <p>But how are we to know when to credit the animal with intelligence and
 when with something less spontaneous? Above all, how are we to know when the
 effective action, like opening the mouth the very instant it is touched by
 food in the mother's beak, is just a physiological action like coughing
 or sneezing, and when there is behind it—a mind at work? The answer to
 this question is no doubt that given by Prof. Lloyd Morgan, who may be called
 the founder of comparative psychology, that we must describe the piece of
 behaviour very carefully, just as it occurred, without reading anything into
 it, and that we must not ascribe it to a higher faculty if it can be
 satisfactorily accounted for in terms of a lower one. In following this
 principle we may be sometimes niggardly, for the behaviour may have a mental
 subtlety that we have missed; but in nine cases out of ten our conclusions
 are likely to be sound. It is the critical, scientific way.</p>
            <p>Bearing this law in mind, let us take a survey of the emergence of mind

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>Fishes cannot shut their eyes, having no true lids; but the eyes
 themselves are very well developed and the vision is acute,<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 211]</ph> especially for
 moving objects. Except in gristly fishes, the external opening to the ear has
 been lost, so that sound-waves and coarser vibrations must influence the
 inner ear, which is well developed, through the surrounding flesh and bones.
 It seems that the main use of the ear in fishes is in connection with
 balancing, not with hearing. In many cases, however, the sense of hearing has
 been demonstrated; thus fishes will come to the side of a pond to be fed when
 a bell is rung or when a whistle is blown by someone not visible from the
 water. The fact that many fishes pay no attention at all to loud noises does
 not prove that they are deaf, for an animal may hear a sound and yet remain
 quite indifferent or irresponsive. This merely means that the sound has no
 vital interest for the animal. Some fishes, such as bullhead and dogfish,
 have a true sense of smell, detecting by their nostrils very dilute
 substances permeating the water from a distance. Others, such as members of
 the cod family, perceive their food in part at least by the sense of taste,
 which is susceptible to substances near at hand and present in considerable
 quantity. This sense of taste may be located on the fins as well as about the
 mouth. At this low level the senses of smell and taste do not seem to be very
 readily separated. The chief use of the sensitive line or lateral line seen
 on each side of a bony fish is to make the animal aware of slow vibrations
 and changes of pressure in the water. The skin responds to pressures, the ear
 to vibrations of high frequency; the lateral line is between the two in its
 function.</p>

            <p>The brain of the ordinary bony fish is at a very low level. Thus the
 cerebral hemispheres, destined to become more and more the seat of
 intelligence, are poorly developed. In gristly fishes, like skates and
 sharks, the brain is much more promising. But although the state of the brain
 does not lead one to expect very much from a bony fish like trout or eel,
 haddock or herring, illustrations<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 212]</ph> are not wanting of what might be called pretty
 pieces of behaviour. Let us select a few cases.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>The three-spined and two-spined sticklebacks live equally well in fresh or
 salt water; the larger fifteen-spined stickleback is entirely marine. In all
 three species the male fish makes a nest, in fresh or brackish water in the
 first two cases, in shore-pools in the third case. The little species use the
 leaves and stems of water-plants; the larger species use seaweed and
 zoophyte. The leaves or fronds are entangled together and fastened by
 glue-like threads, secreted, strange to say, by the kidneys. It is just as if
 a temporary diseased condition had been regularised and turned to good
 purpose. Going through the nest several times, the male makes a little room
 in the middle. Partly by coercion and partly by coaxing he induces a
 female—first one and then another—to pass through the nest with
 two doors, depositing eggs during her short sojourn. The females go their
 way, and the male mounts guard over the nest. He drives off intruding fishes
 much bigger than himself. When the young are hatched, the male has for a time
 much to do, keeping his charges within bounds until they are able to move
 about with agility. It seems that sticklebacks are short-lived fishes,
 probably breeding only once; and it is reasonable to suppose that their
 success as a race depends to some extent on the paternal care. Now if we
 could believe that the nesting behaviour had appeared suddenly in its present
 form, we should be inclined to credit the fish with considerable mental
 ability. But we are less likely to be so generous if we reflect that the
 routine has been in all likelihood the outcome of a long racial process of
 slight improvements and critical testings. The secretion of the glue probably
 came about as a pathological variation; its utilisation was perhaps
 discovered by accident; the types that had wit enough to take advantage of
 this were most successful; the routine became enregistered hereditarily. The
 stickleback is not so clever as it looks.</p>

            <ph outputclass="title-line">The Mind of a Minnow</ph> 
         </title>
         <body>
            <p>To find solid ground on which to base an appreciation of the behaviour of
 fishes, it is necessary to experiment, and we may refer to Miss Gertrude
 White's interesting work on American minnows and sticklebacks. After the
 fishes had become quite at home in their artificial surroundings, their
 lessons began. Cloth packets, one of which contained meat and the other
 cotton, were suspended at opposite ends of the aquarium. The mud-minnows did
 not show that they perceived either packet, though they swam close by them;
 the sticklebacks were intrigued at once. Those that went towards the packet
 containing meat darted furiously upon it and pulled at it with great
 excitement. Those that went towards the cotton packet turned sharply away
 when they were within about two inches off. They then perceived what those at
 the other end were after and joined them—a common habit amongst fishes.
 Although the minnows were not interested in the tiny "bags of
 mystery," they were even more alert than the sticklebacks in perceiving
 moving objects in or on the water, and there is no doubt that both these
 shallow-water species discover their food largely by sense of sight.</p>
            <p>The next set of lessons had to do with colour-associations. The fishes
 were fed on minced snail, chopped earthworm, fragments of liver, and the
 like, and the food was given to them from the end of forceps held above the
 surface of the water, so that the fishes could not be influenced by smell.
 They had to leap out of the water to take the food from the forceps. Discs of
 coloured cardboard were slipped over the end of the forceps, so that what the
 fishes saw was a morsel of food in the centre of a coloured disc. After a
 week or so of preliminary training, they were so well accustomed to the
 coloured discs that the presentation of one served as a signal for the fishes
 to dart to the surface and spring out of the water. When baits of paper were
 substituted for the food, the fishes continued to jump at the discs. When,
 however, a blue disc was persistently used for the paper bait and a red
 disc<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 214]</ph> for the real food, or <i>vice versa</i>, some of the minnows
 learned to discriminate infallibly between shadow and substance, both when
 these were presented alternately and when they were presented simultaneously.
 This is not far from the dawn of mind.</p>
            <p>In the course of a few lessons, both minnows and sticklebacks learned to
 associate particular colours with food, and other associations were also
 formed. A kind of larva that a minnow could make nothing of after repeated
 trials was subsequently ignored. The approach of the experimenter or anyone
 else soon began to serve as a food-signal. There can be no doubt that in the
 ordinary life of fishes there is a process of forming useful associations and
 suppressing useless responses. Given an inborn repertory of profitable
 movements that require no training, given the power of forming associations
 such as those we have illustrated, and given a considerable degree of sensory
 alertness along certain lines, fishes do not require much more. And in truth
 they have not got it. Moving with great freedom in three dimensions in a
 medium that supports them and is very uniform and constant, able in most
 cases to get plenty of food without fatiguing exertions and to dispense with
 it for considerable periods if it is scarce, multiplying usually in great
 abundance so that the huge infantile mortality hardly counts, rarely dying a
 natural death but usually coming with their strength unabated to a violent
 end, fishes hold their own in the struggle for existence without much in the
 way of mental endowment. Their brain has more to do with motion than with
 mentality, and they have remained at a low psychical level.</p>
            <p>Yet just as we should greatly misjudge our own race if we confined our
 attention to everyday routine, so in our total, as distinguished from our
 average, estimate of fishes, we must remember the salmon surmounting the
 falls, the wary trout eluding the angler's skill, the common mud-skipper
 (Periophthalmus) of many tropical shores which climbs on the rocks and the
 roots of the mangrove-trees, or actively hunts small shore-animals.
 We<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 215]</ph>
 must remember the adventurous life-history of the eel and the quaint ways in
 which some fishes, males especially, look after their family. The male
 sea-horse puts the eggs in his breast-pocket; the male Kurtus carries them on
 the top of his head; the cock-paidle or lumpsucker guards them and aerates
 them in a corner of a shore-pool.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>Towards the end of the age of the Old Red Sandstone or Devonian, a great
 step in evolution was taken—the emergence of Amphibians. The earliest
 representatives had fish-like characters even more marked than those which
 may be discerned in the tadpoles of our frogs and toads, and there is no
 doubt that amphibians sprang from a fish stock. But they made great strides,
 associated in part with their attempts to get out of the water on to dry
 land. From fossil forms we cannot say much in regard to soft parts; but if we
 consider the living representatives of the class, we may credit amphibians
 with such important acquisitions as fingers and toes, a three-chambered
 heart, true ventral lungs, a drum to the ear, a mobile tongue, and vocal
 cords. When animals began to be able to grasp an object and when they began
 to be able to utter sufficient sounds, two new doors were opened. Apart from
 insects, whose instrumental music had probably begun before the end of the
 Devonian age, amphibians were the first animals to have a voice. The primary
 meaning of this voice was doubtless, as it is to-day in our frogs, a
 sex-call; but it was the beginning of what was destined to play a very
 important part in the evolution of the mind. In the course of ages the
 significance of the voice broadened out; it became a parental call; it became
 an infant's cry. Broadening still, it became a very useful means of
 recognition among kindred, especially in the dark and in the intricacies of
 the forest. Ages passed, and the voice rose on another turn of the
 evolutionary spiral to be expressive of particular<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 216]</ph> emotions
 beyond the immediate circle of sex—emotions of joy and of fear, of
 jealousy and of contentment. Finally, we judge, the animal—perhaps the
 bird was first—began to give utterance to particular "words,"
 indicative not merely of emotions, but of particular things with an emotional
 halo, such as "food," "enemy," "home." Long
 afterwards, words became <i>in man</i> the medium of reasoned discourse.
 Sentences were made and judgments expressed. But was not the beginning in the
 croaking of Amphibia?</p>

            <p>Frogs have good eyes, and the toad's eyes are "jewels."
 There is evidence of precise vision in the neat way in which a frog catches a
 fly, flicking out its tongue, which is fixed in front and loose behind. There
 is also experimental proof that a frog discriminates between red and blue, or
 between red and white, and an interesting point is that while our skin is
 sensitive to heat rays but not to light, the skin of the frog answers back to
 light rays as well. Professor Yerkes experimented with a frog which had to go
 through a simple labyrinth if it wished to reach a tank of water. At the
 first alternative between two paths, a red card was placed on the wrong side
 and a white one on the other. When the frog had learned to take the correct
 path, marked by the white card, Prof. Yerkes changed the cards. The confusion
 of the frog showed how thoroughly it had learned its lesson.</p>
            <p>We know very little in regard to sense of smell or taste in amphibians;
 but the sense of hearing is well developed, more developed than might be
 inferred from the indifference that frogs show to almost all sounds except
 the croaking of their kindred and splashes in the water.</p>
            <p>The toad looks almost sagacious when it is climbing up a bank, and some of
 the tree-frogs are very alert; but there is very little that we dare say
 about the amphibian mind. We have mentioned that frogs may learn the secret
 of a simple maze, and toads<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 217]</ph> sometimes make for a particular spawning-pond
 from a considerable distance. But an examination of their brains, occupying a
 relatively small part of the broad, flat skull, warns us not to expect much
 intelligence. On the other hand, when we take frogs along a line that is very
 vital to them, namely, the discrimination of palatable and unpalatable
 insects, we find, by experiment, that they are quick to learn and that they
 remember their lessons for many days. Frogs sometimes deposit their eggs in
 very unsuitable pools of water; but perhaps that is not quite so stupid as it
 looks. The egg-laying is a matter that has been, as it were, handed over to
 instinctive registration.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>It must be put to the credit of amphibians that they have made many
 experiments in methods of parental care, as if they were feeling their way to
 new devices. A common frog lays her clumps of eggs in the cradle of the
 water, sometimes far over a thousand together; the toad winds two long
 strings round and between water-weeds; and in both cases that is all. There
 is no parental care, and the prolific multiplication covers the enormous
 infantile mortality. This is the spawning solution of the problem of securing
 the continuance of the race. But there is another solution, that of parental
 care associated with an economical reduction of the number of eggs. Thus the
 male of the Nurse-Frog (Alytes), not uncommon on the Continent, fixes a
 string of twenty to fifty eggs to the upper part of his hind-legs, and
 retires to his hole, only coming out at night to get some food and to keep up
 the moisture about the eggs. In three weeks, when the tadpoles are ready to
 come out, he plunges into the pond and is freed from his living burden and
 his family cares. In the case of the thoroughly aquatic Surinam Toad (Pipa),
 the male helps to press the eggs, perhaps a hundred in number, on to the back
 of the female, where each sinks into a pocket of skin with a little lid. By
 and by fully formed young toads jump out of the pockets.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 218]</ph>
            </p>
            <p>In the South American tree-frogs called Nototrema there is a pouch on the
 back of the female in which the eggs develop, and it is interesting to find
 that in some species what come out are ordinary tadpoles, while in other
 species the young emerge as miniatures of their parents. Strangest of all,
 perhaps, is the case of Darwin's Frog (Rhinoderma of Chili), where the
 young, about ten to fifteen in number, develop in the male's
 croaking-sacs, which become in consequence enormously distended. Eventually
 the strange spectacle is seen of miniature frogs jumping out of their
 father's mouth. Needless to say we are not citing these methods of
 parental care as examples of intelligence; but perhaps they correct the
 impression of amphibians as a rather humdrum race. Whatever be the mental
 aspect of the facts, there has certainly been some kind of experimenting, and
 the increase of parental care, so marked in many amphibians, with associated
 reduction of the number of offspring is a finger-post on the path of
 progress.</p>

            <ph outputclass="title-line">The Reptilian Mind</ph> 
         </title>
         <body>
            <p>We speak of the wisdom of the serpent; but it is not very easy to justify
 the phrase. Among all the multitude of reptiles—snakes, lizards,
 turtles, and crocodiles, a motley crowd—we cannot see much more than
 occasional traces of intelligence. The inner life remains a tiny rill.</p>
            <p>No doubt many reptiles are very effective; but it is an instinctive rather
 than an intelligent efficiency. The well-known "soft-shell"
 tortoise of the United States swims with powerful strokes and runs so quickly
 that it can hardly be overtaken. It hunts vigorously for crayfish and insect
 larvæ in the rivers. It buries itself in the mud when cold weather comes. It
 may lie on a floating log ready to slip into the water at a moment's
 notice; it may bask on a sunny bank or in the warm shallows. Great wariness
 is shown in choosing times and places for egg-laying. The mother tramps the
 earth down upon the buried eggs. All is effective.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 219]</ph> Similar
 statements might be made in regard to scores of other reptiles; but what we
 see is almost wholly of the nature of instinctive routine, and we get little
 glimpse of more than efficiency and endeavour.</p>
            <p>In a few cases there is proof of reptiles finding their way back to their
 homes from a considerable distance, and recognition of persons is
 indubitable. Gilbert White remarks of his tortoise: "Whenever the good
 old lady came in sight who had waited on it for more than thirty years, it
 always hobbled with awkward alacrity towards its benefactress, while to
 strangers it was altogether inattentive." Of definite learning there are
 a few records. Thus Professor Yerkes studied a sluggish turtle of retiring
 disposition, taking advantage of its strong desire to efface itself. On the
 path of the darkened nest of damp grass he interposed a simple maze in the
 form of a partitioned box. After wandering about constantly for thirty-five
 minutes the turtle found its way through the maze by chance. Two hours
 afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen minutes; and after another interval
 of two hours it only required five minutes. After the third trial, the routes
 became more direct, there was less aimless wandering. The time of the
 twentieth trial was forty-five seconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds.
 In the thirtieth case, the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on
 the fiftieth trip, which only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the
 whole thing did not amount to very much; but there was a definite learning,
 <i>a learning from experience</i>, which has played an important part in the
 evolution of animal behaviour.</p>
            <p>Comparing reptiles with amphibians, we may recognise an increased
 masterliness of behaviour and a hint of greater plasticity. The records of
 observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of feeling or
 emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they can be accepted,
 which suggest the beginning of conjugal affection.</p>
            <p>The error must be guarded against of interpreting in terms<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 220]</ph> of
 intelligence what is merely the outcome of long-continued structure
 adaptation. When the limbless lizard called the Slow-worm is suddenly seized
 by the tail, it escapes by surrendering the appendage, which breaks across a
 preformed weak plane. But this is a reflex action, not a reflective one. It
 is comparable to our sudden withdrawal of our finger from a very hot cinder.
 The Egg-eating African snake Dasypeltis gets the egg of a bird into its
 gullet unbroken, and cuts the shell against downward-projecting sharp points
 of the vertebræ. None of the precious contents is lost and the broken
 "empties" are returned. It is admirable, indeed unsurpassable; but
 it is not intelligent.</p>

         <body>
            <p>Sight and hearing are highly developed in birds, and the senses, besides
 pulling the triggers of inborn efficiencies, supply the raw materials for
 intelligence. There is some truth, though not the whole truth, in the old
 philosophical dictum, that there is nothing in the intellect which was not
 previously in the senses. Many people have admired the certainty and alacrity
 with which gulls pick up a fragment of biscuit from the white wake of a
 steamer, and the incident is characteristic. In their power of rapidly
 altering the focus of the eye, birds are unsurpassed.</p>
            <p>To the sense of sight in birds, the sense of hearing comes a good second.
 A twig breaks under our feet, and out sounds the danger-call of the bird we
 were trying to watch. Many young birds, like partridges, respond when two or
 three hours old to the anxious warning note of the parents, and squat
 motionless on the ground, though other sounds, such as the excited clucking
 of a foster-mother hen, leave them indifferent. They do not know what they
 are doing when they squat; they are obeying the living hand of the past which
 is within them. Their behaviour is instinctive. But the present point is the
 discriminating quality of the sense of hearing; and that is corroborated by
 the singing of birds.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 221]</ph> It is emotional art, expressing feelings in
 the medium of sound. On the part of the females, who are supposed to listen,
 it betokens a cultivated ear.</p>

            <p>As to the other senses, touch is not highly developed except about the
 bill, where it reaches a climax in birds like the wood-cock, which probe for
 unseen earthworms in the soft soil. Taste seems to be poorly developed, for
 most birds bolt their food, but there is sometimes an emphatic rejection of
 unpalatable things, like toads and caterpillars. Of smell in birds little is
 known, but it has been proved to be present in certain cases, e.g. in some
 nocturnal birds of prey. It seems certain that it is by sight, not by smell,
 that the eagles gather to the carcass; but perhaps there is more smell in
 birds than they are usually credited with. One would like to experiment with
 the oil from the preen gland of birds to see whether the scent of this does
 not help in the recognition of kin by kin at night or amid the darkness of
 the forest. There may be other senses in birds, such as a sense of
 temperature and a sense of balance; but no success has attended the attempts
 made to demonstrate a magnetic sense, which has been impatiently postulated
 by students of bird migration in order to "explain" how the birds
 find their way. The big fact is that in birds there are two widely open
 gateways of knowledge, the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.</p>

            <p>Many a young water-bird, such as a coot, swims right away when it is
 tumbled into water for the first time. So chicks peck without any learning or
 teaching, very young ducklings catch small moths that flit by, and young
 plovers lie low when the danger-signal sounds. But birds seem strangely
 limited as regards many of these instinctive capacities—limited when
 compared with the "little-brained" ants and bees, which have from
 the first such a rich repertory of ready-made cleverness. The limitation in
 birds is of great interest, for it means that intelligence is
 coming<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 222]</ph> to its own and is going to take up the reins at many corners
 of the daily round. Professor Lloyd Morgan observed that his chickens
 incubated in the laboratory had no instinctive awareness of the significance
 of their mother's cluck when she was brought outside the door. Although
 thirsty and willing to drink from a moistened finger-tip, they did not
 instinctively recognize water, even when they walked through a saucerful.
 Only when they happened to peck their toes as they stood in the water did
 they appreciate water as the stuff they wanted, and raise their bills up to
 the sky. Once or twice they actually stuffed their crops with
 "worms" of red worsted!</p>
            <p>Instinctive aptitudes, then, the young birds have, but these are more
 limited than in ants, bees, and wasps; and the reason is to be found in the
 fact that the brain is now evolving on the tack of what Sir Ray Lankester has
 called "educability." Young birds <i>learn</i> with prodigious
 rapidity; the emancipation of the mind from the tyranny of hereditary
 obligations has begun. Young birds make mistakes, like the red worsted
 mistake, but they do not make the same mistakes often. They are able to
 profit by experience in a very rapid way. We do not mean that creatures of
 the little-brain type, like ants, bees, and wasps, are unable to profit by
 experience or are without intelligence. There are no such hard-and-fast
 lines. We mean that in the ordinary life of insects the enregistered
 instinctive capacities are on the whole sufficient for the occasion, and that
 intelligent educability is very slightly developed. Nor do we mean that birds
 are quite emancipated from the tyranny of engrained instinctive obligations,
 and can always "ring up" intelligence in a way that is impossible
 for the stereotyped bee. The sight of a pigeon brooding on an empty nest,
 while her two eggs lie disregarded only a couple of inches away, is enough to
 show that along certain lines birds may find it impossible to get free from
 the trammels of instinct. The peculiar interest of birds is that they have
 many instincts and yet a notable power of learning intelligently.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 223]</ph>

         <body>
            <p>Professor Lloyd Morgan was foster-parent to two moorhens which grew up in
 isolation from their kindred. They swam instinctively, but they would not
 dive, neither in a large bath nor in a current. But it happened one day when
 one of these moorhens was swimming in a pool on a Yorkshire stream, that a
 puppy came barking down the bank and made an awkward feint towards the young
 bird. In a moment the moorhen dived, disappeared from view, and soon
 partially reappeared, his head just peeping above the water beneath the
 overhanging bank. This was the first time the bird had dived, and the
 performance was absolutely true to type.</p>
            <p>There can be little doubt as to the meaning of this observation. The
 moorhen has an hereditary or instinctive capacity for swimming and diving,
 but the latter is not so easily called into activity as the former. The
 particular moorhen in question had enjoyed about two months of swimming
 experience, which probably counted for something, but in the course of that
 experience nothing had pulled the trigger of the diving capacity. On an
 eventful day the young moorhen saw and heard the dog; it was emotionally
 excited; it probably did to some extent intelligently appreciate a novel and
 meaningful situation. Intelligence cooperated with instinct, and the bird
 dived appropriately.</p>
            <p>Birds have inborn predispositions to certain effective ways of pecking,
 scratching, swimming, diving, flying, crouching, lying low, nest-building,
 and so on; but they are marked off from the much more purely instinctive ants
 and bees by the extent to which individual "nurture" seems to
 mingle with the inherited "nature." The two together result in the
 fine product which we call the bird's behaviour. After Lloyd Morgan's
 chicks had tried a few conspicuous and unpalatable caterpillars, they had no
 use for any more. They learned in their early days with prodigious rapidity,
 illustrating the deep difference between the "big-brain" type,
 relatively poor in its endowment of instinctive<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 224]</ph> capacities, but eminently
 "educable," and the "little-brain" type, say, of ants and
 bees, richly endowed with instinctive capacities, but very far from being
 quick or glad to learn. We owe it to Sir Ray Lankester to have made it clear
 that these two types of brain are, as it were, on different tacks of
 evolution, and should not be directly pitted against one another. The
 "little-brain" type makes for a climax in the ant, where
 instinctive behaviour reaches a high degree of perfection; the
 "big-brain" type reaches its climax in horse and dog, in elephant
 and monkey. The particular interest that attaches to the behaviour of birds
 is in the combination of a good deal of instinct with a great deal of
 intelligent learning. This is well illustrated when birds make a nest out of
 new materials or in some quite novel situation. It is clearly seen when birds
 turn to some new kind of food, like the Kea parrot, which attacks the sheep
 in New Zealand.</p>
            <p>Some young woodpeckers are quite clever in opening fir cones to get at the
 seeds, and this might be hastily referred to a well-defined hereditary
 capacity. But the facts are that the parents bring their young ones first the
 seeds themselves, then partly opened cones, and then intact ones. There is an
 educative process, and so it is in scores of cases.</p>

 the expedient by experimenting, as is possible, or by chance, as is more
 likely, it uses it intelligently. In the same way herring-gulls lift
 sea-urchins and clams in their bills, and let them fall on the rocks so that
 the shells are broken. In the same way rooks deal with freshwater

            <p>A very instructive case is the behaviour of the song-thrush when it takes
 a wood-snail in its beak and hammers it against a<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 225]</ph> stone, its
 so-called anvil. To a young thrush, which she had brought up by hand, Miss
 Frances Pitt offered some wood-snails, but it took no interest in them until
 one put out its head and began to move about. The bird then pecked at the
 snail's horns, but was evidently puzzled when the creature retreated
 within the shelter of the shell. This happened over and over again, the
 thrush's inquisitive interest increasing day by day. It pecked at the
 shell and even picked it up by the lip, but no real progress was made till
 the sixth day, when the thrush seized the snail and beat it on the ground as
 it would a big worm. On the same day it picked up a shell and knocked it
 repeatedly against a stone, trying first one snail and then another. After
 fifteen minutes' hard work, the thrush managed to break one, and after
 that it was all easy. A certain predisposition to beat things on the ground
 was doubtless present, but the experiment showed that the use of an anvil
 could be arrived at by an untutored bird. After prolonged trying it found out
 how to deal with a difficult situation. It may be said that in more natural
 conditions this might be picked up by imitation, but while this is quite
 possible, it is useful to notice that experiments with animals lead us to
 doubt whether imitation counts for nearly so much as used to be believed.</p>

 are apt to be too stingy, for these rodents are under the average of mammals,
 and those that live in domestication illustrate the stupefying effect of a
 too sheltered life. The same applies to domesticated sheep contrasted with
 wild sheep, or even with<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 226]</ph> their own lambs. If we are to form a sound
 judgment on the intelligence of mammals we must not attend too much to those
 that have profited by man's training, nor to those whose mental life has

 perfection by all the members of the same species, there are acquired
 dexterities which depend on individual opportunities. They are also marked by
 being outside and beyond ordinary routine—not that any rigorous
 boundary line can be drawn. We read that at Mathura on the Jumna doles of
 food are provided by the piety of pilgrims for the sacred river-tortoises,
 which are so crowded when there is food going that their smooth carapaces
 form a more or less continuous raft across the river. On that unsteady
 slippery bridge the Langur monkeys (<i>Semnopithecus entellus</i>) venture
 out and in spite of vicious snaps secure a share of the booty. This picture
 of the monkeys securing a footing on the moving mass of turtle-backs is
 almost a diagram of sheer dexterity. It illustrates the spirit of adventure,
 the will to experiment, which is, we believe, the main motive-force in new
 departures in behaviour.</p>

            <p>A bull-terrier called Jasper, studied by Prof. J. B. Watson, showed great
 power of associating certain words with certain actions. From a position
 invisible to the dog the owner would give certain commands, such as "Go
 into the next room and bring me a paper lying on the floor." Jasper did
 this at once, and a score of similar things.</p>
            <p>Lord Avebury's dog Van was accustomed to go to a box containing a
 small number of printed cards and select the card TEA or OUT, as the occasion
 suggested. It had established an association between certain black marks on a
 white background and the gratification of certain desires. It is probable
 that some of the extraordinary things horses and dogs have been known to do
 in the way of stamping a certain number of times in supposed indication of an
 answer to an arithmetical question (in the case of horses), or of the name of
 an object drawn (in the case of dogs), are dependent on clever associations
 established by the teacher between minute signs and a number of stampings.
 What is certain is that mammals have in varying degrees a strong power of
 establishing associations. There is often some delicacy in the association
 established. Everyone knows of cases where a dog, a cat, or a horse will
 remain quite uninterested, to all appearance, in its owner's movements
 until some little detail, such as taking a key from its peg, pulls the
 trigger. Now the importance of this in the wild life of the fox or the hare,
 the otter or the squirrel, is obviously that the young animals learn to
 associate certain sounds in their environment with definite possibilities.
 They have to learn an alphabet of woodcraft, the letters of which are chiefly
 sounds and scents.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>The dancing or waltzing mouse is a Japanese variety with many
 peculiarities, such as having only one of the three semicircular canals of
 the ear well developed. It has a strong tendency<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 228]</ph> to waltz round
 and round in circles without sufficient cause and to trip sideways towards
 its dormitory instead of proceeding in the orthodox head-on fashion. But this
 freak is a very educable creature, as Professor Yerkes has shown. In a
 careful way he confronted his mouse-pupil with alternative pathways marked by
 different degrees of illumination, or by different colours. If the mouse
 chose compartment A, it found a clear passage direct to its nest; if it chose
 compartment B, it was punished by a mild electric shock and it had to take a
 roundabout road home. Needless to say, the A compartment was sometimes to the
 right hand, sometimes to the left, else mere position would have been a
 guide. The experiments showed that the dancing mice learn to discriminate the
 right path from the wrong, and similar results have been got from other
 mammals, such as rats and squirrels. There is no proof of learning by ideas,
 but there is proof of learning by experience. And the same must be true in
 wild life.</p>
            <p>Many mammals, such as cats and rats, learn how to manipulate puzzle-boxes
 and how to get at the treasure at the heart of a Hampton Court maze. Some of
 the puzzle-boxes, with a reward of food inside, are quite difficult, for the
 various bolts and bars have to be dealt with in a particular order, and yet
 many mammals master the problem. What is plain is that they gradually
 eliminate useless movements, that they make fewer and fewer mistakes, that
 they eventually succeed, and that they register the solution within
 themselves so that it remains with them for a time. It looks a little like
 the behaviour of a man who learns a game of skill without thinking. It is a
 learning by experience, not by ideas or reflection. Thus it is very difficult
 to suppose that a rat or a cat could form any idea or even picture of the
 Hampton Court maze—which they nevertheless master.</p>

            <p>Given sufficient inducement many of the cleverer mammals will learn to do
 very sensible things, and no one is wise enough to<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 229]</ph> say that they
 never understand what they are doing. Yet it is certain that trained animals
 often exhibit pieces of behaviour which are not nearly so clever as they
 look. The elephant at the Belle Vue Gardens in Manchester used to collect
 pennies from benevolent visitors. When it got a penny in its trunk it put it
 in the slot of an automatic machine which delivered up a biscuit. When a
 visitor gave the elephant a halfpenny it used to throw it back with disgust.
 At first sight this seemed almost wise, and there was no doubt some
 intelligent appreciation of the situation. But it was largely a matter of
 habituation, the outcome of careful and prolonged training. The elephant was
 laboriously taught to put the penny in the slot and to discriminate between
 the useful pennies and the useless halfpennies. It was not nearly so clever
 as it looked.</p>

            <p>In the beautiful Zoological Park in Edinburgh the Polar Bear was wont to
 sit on a rocky peninsula of a water-filled quarry. The visitors threw in
 buns, some of which floated on the surface. It was often easy for the Polar
 Bear to collect half a dozen by plunging into the pool. But it had discovered
 a more interesting way. At the edge of the peninsula it scooped the water
 gently with its huge paw and made a current which brought the buns ashore.
 This was a simple piece of behaviour, but it has the smack of
 intelligence—of putting two and two together in a novel way. It
 suggests the power of making what is called a "perceptual
 inference."</p>
            <p>On the occasion of a great flood in a meadow it was observed that a number
 of mares brought their foals to the top of a knoll, and stood round about
 them protecting them against the rising water. A dog has been known to show
 what was at any rate a plastic appreciation of a varying situation in
 swimming across a tidal river. It changed its starting-point, they say,
 according to the flow or ebb of the tide. Arctic foxes and some other

 manipulative intelligence of elephants is worthy of all our admiration.</p>

         <body>
            <p>When we allow for dexterity and power of association, when we recognise a
 certain amount of instinctive capacity and a capacity for profiting by
 experience in an intelligent way, we must admit a certain degree of
 disappointment when we take a survey of the behaviour of mammals, especially
 of those with very fine brains, from which we should naturally expect great
 things. Why is there not more frequent exhibition of intelligence in the
 stricter sense?</p>
            <p>The answer is that most mammals have become in the course of time very
 well adapted to the ordinary conditions of their life, and tend to leave well
 alone. They have got their repertory of efficient answers to the ordinary
 questions of everyday life, and why should they experiment? In the course of
 the struggle for existence what has been established is efficiency in normal
 circumstances, and therefore even the higher animals tend to be no cleverer
 than is necessary. So while many mammals are extraordinarily efficient, they
 tend to be a little dull. Their mental equipment is adequate for the everyday
 conditions of their life, but it is not on sufficiently generous lines to
 admit of, let us say, an interest in Nature or adventurous experiment.
 Mammals always tend to "play for safety."</p>

 clauses.</p>

         <body>
            <p>A glimpse of what mammals are capable of, were it necessary, may be
 obtained by watching those that are playful, such as lambs and kids, foals
 and calves, young foxes and others. For<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 231]</ph> these young creatures let
 themselves go irresponsibly, they are still unstereotyped, they test what
 they and their fellows can do. The experimental character of much of animal
 play is very marked.</p>
            <p>It is now recognised by biologists that play among animals is the young
 form of work, and that the playing period, often so conspicuous, is vitally
 important as an apprenticeship to the serious business of life and as an
 opportunity for learning the alphabet of Nature. But the playing period is
 much more; it is one of the few opportunities animals have of making
 experiments without too serious responsibilities. Play is Nature's device
 for allowing elbow-room for new departures (behaviour-variations) which may
 form part of the raw materials of progress. Play, we repeat, gives us a
 glimpse of the possibilities of the mammal mind.</p>

            <p>A squirrel is just as clever as it needs to be and no more; and of some
 vanishing mammals, like the beaver, not even this can be said. Humdrum
 non-plastic efficiency is apt to mean stagnation. Now we have just seen that
 in the play of young mammals there is an indication of unexhausted
 possibilities, and we get the same impression when we think of three other
 facts. (<i>a</i>) In those mammals, like dog and horse, which have entered
 into active cooperative relations with man, we see that the mind of the
 mammal is capable of much more than the average would lead us to think. When
 man's sheltering is too complete and the domesticated creature is passive
 in his grip, the intelligence deteriorates. (<i>b</i>) When we study mammals,
 like the otter, which live a versatile life in a very complex and difficult
 environment, we get an inspiriting picture of the play of wits. (<i>c</i>)
 Thirdly, when we pass to monkeys, where the fore-limb has become a free hand,
 where the brain shows a relatively great improvement, where "words"
 are much used, we cannot fail to recognise the emergence of
 something<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg

 the world, an unsatisfied tendency to experiment. We are approaching the Dawn

         <body>
            <p>To begin at the beginning, it is certain that monkeys have a first-class
 sensory equipment, especially as regards sight, hearing, and touch. The axes
 of the two eyes are directed forwards as in man, and a large section of the
 field of vision is common to both eyes. In other words, monkeys have a more
 complete stereoscopic vision than the rest of the mammals enjoy. They look
 more and smell less. They can distinguish different colours, apart from
 different degrees of brightness in the coloured objects. They are quick to
 discriminate differences in the shapes of things, e.g. boxes similar in size
 but different in shape, for if the prize is always put in a box of the same
 shape they soon learn (by association) to select the profitable one. They
 learn to discriminate cards with short words or with signs printed on them,
 coming down when the "Yes" card is shown, remaining on their perch
 when the card says "No." Bred to a forest life where alertness is a
 life-or-death quality, they are quick to respond to a sudden movement or to
 pick out some new feature in their surroundings. And what is true of vision
 holds also for hearing.</p>

            <p>Another quality which separates monkeys very markedly from ordinary
 mammals is their manipulative expertness, the co-ordination<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 233]</ph> of hand and
 eye. This great gift follows from the fact that among monkeys the fore-leg
 has been emancipated. It has ceased to be indispensable as an organ of
 support; it has become a climbing, grasping, lifting, handling organ. The
 fore-limb has become a free hand, and everyone who knows monkeys at all is
 aware of the zest with which they use their tool. They enjoy pulling things
 to pieces—a kind of dissection—or screwing the handle off a brush
 and screwing it on again.</p>

         <body>
            <p>Professor Thorndike hits the nail on the head when he lays stress on the
 intensity of activity in monkeys—activity both of body and mind. They
 are pent-up reservoirs of energy, which almost any influence will tap. Watch
 a cat or a dog, Professor Thorndike says; it does comparatively few things
 and is content for long periods to do nothing. It will be splendidly active
 in response to some stimulus such as food or a friend or a fight, but if
 nothing appeals to its special make-up, which is very utilitarian in its
 interests, it will do nothing. "Watch a monkey and you cannot enumerate
 the things he does, cannot discover the stimuli to which he reacts, cannot
 conceive the <i>raison d'etre</i> of his pursuits. Everything appeals to
 him. He likes to be active for the sake of activity."</p>
            <p>This applies to mental activity as well, and the quality is one of
 extraordinary interest, for it shows the experimenting mood at a higher turn
 of the spiral than in any other creature, save man. It points forward to the
 scientific spirit. We cannot, indeed, believe in the sudden beginning of any
 quality, and we recall the experimenting of playing mammals, such as kids and
 kittens, or of inquisitive adults like Kipling's mongoose,
 Riki-Tiki-Tavi, which made it his business in life to find out about things.
 But in monkeys the habit of restless experimenting rises to a higher pitch.
 They appear to be curious about the world. The psychologist whom we have
 quoted tells of a monkey which<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 234]</ph> happened to hit a projecting wire so as to
 make it vibrate. He went on repeating the performance hundreds of times
 during the next few days. Of course, he got nothing out of it, save fun, but
 it was grist to his mental mill. "The fact of mental life is to monkeys
 it own reward." The monkey's brain is "tender all over,
 functioning throughout, set off in action by anything and
 everything."</p>

            <p>Correlated with the quality of restless inquisitiveness and delight in
 activity for its own sake there is the quality of quickness. We mean not
 merely the locomotor agility that marks most monkeys, but quickness of
 perception and plan. It is the sort of quality that life among the branches
 will engender, where it is so often a case of neck or nothing. It is the
 quality which we describe as being on the spot, though the phrase has slipped
 from its original moorings. Speaking of his Bonnet Monkey, an Indian macaque,
 second cousin to the kind that lives on the Rock of Gibraltar, Professor S.
 J. Holmes writes: "For keenness of perception, rapidity of action,
 facility in forming good practical judgments about ways and means of escaping
 pursuit and of attaining various other ends, Lizzie had few rivals in the
 animal world.... Her perceptions and decisions were so much more rapid than
 my own that she would frequently transfer her attention, decide upon a line
 of action, and carry it into effect before I was aware of what she was about.
 Until I came to guard against her nimble and unexpected manœuvres, she
 succeeded in getting possession of many apples and peanuts which I had not
 intended to give her except upon the successful performance of some
 task."</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>Some of us remember Sally, the chimpanzee at the "Zoo" with
 which Dr. Romanes used to experiment. She was taught to give her teacher the
 number of straws he asked for, and she soon learned to do so up to five. If
 she handed a number not asked for, her offer was refused; if she gave the
 proper number, she got a piece of fruit. If she was asked for five straws,
 she picked them up individually and placed them in her mouth, and when she
 had gathered five she presented them together in her hand. Attempts to teach
 her to give six to ten straws were not very successful. For Sally "above
 six" meant "many," and besides, her limits of patience were
 probably less than her range of computation. This was hinted at by the highly
 interesting circumstance that when dealing with numbers above five she very
 frequently doubled over a straw so as to make it present two ends and thus
 appear as two straws. The doubling of the straw looked like an intelligent

 that her teacher always refused to accept a doubled straw as equivalent to
 two straws. Here we get a glimpse of something beyond the mere association of
 a sound—"Five"—and that number of straws.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>The front of the cage in which Professor Holmes kept Lizzie was made of
 vertical bars which allowed her to reach out with her arm. On a board with an
 upright nail as handle, there was<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 236]</ph> placed an apple—out of Lizzie's
 reach. She reached immediately for the nail, pulled the board in and got the
 apple. "There was no employment of the method of trial and error; there
 was direct appropriate action following the perception of her relation to
 board, nail, and apple." Of course her ancestors may have been adepts at
 drawing a fruit-laden branch within their reach, but the simple experiment
 was very instructive. All the more instructive because in many other cases
 the experiments indicate a gradual sifting out of useless movements and an
 eventful retention of the one that pays. When Lizzie was given a vaseline
 bottle containing a peanut and closed with a cork, she at once pulled the
 cork out with her teeth, obeying the instinct to bite at new objects, but she
 never learned to turn the bottle upside down and let the nut drop out. She
 often got the nut, and after some education she got it more quickly than she
 did at first, but there was no indication that she ever perceived the fit and
 proper way of getting what she wanted. "In the course of her intent
 efforts her mind seemed so absorbed with the object of desire that it was
 never focussed on the means of attaining that object. There was no
 deliberation, and no discrimination between the important and the unimportant
 elements in her behaviour. The gradually increasing facility of her
 performances depended on the apparently unconscious elimination of useless
 movements." This may be called learning, but it is learning at a very
 low level; it is far from learning by ideas; it is hardly even learning by
 experiment; it is not more than learning by experience, it is not more than
 fumbling at learning!</p>

         <body>
            <p>A higher note is struck in the behaviour of some more highly endowed
 monkeys. In many experiments, chiefly in the way of getting into boxes
 difficult to open, there is evidence (1) of attentive persistent experiment
 (2) of the rapid elimination of ineffective movements, and (3) of remembering
 the solution when it<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 237]</ph> was discovered. Kinnaman taught two macaques
 the Hampton Court Maze, a feat which probably means a memory of movements,
 and we get an interesting glimpse in his observation that they began to smack
 their lips audibly when they reached the latter part of their course, and
 began to feel, dare one say, "We are right this time."</p>
            <p>In getting into "puzzle-boxes" and into
 "combination-boxes" (where the barriers must be overcome in a
 definite order), monkeys learn by the trial and error method much more
 quickly than cats and dogs do, and a very suggestive fact emphasized by
 Professor Thorndike is "a process of sudden acquisition by a rapid,
 often apparently instantaneous abandonment of the unsuccessful movements and
 selection of the appropriate one, which rivals in suddenness the selections
 made by human beings in similar performances." A higher note still was
 sounded by one of Thorndike's monkeys which opened a puzzle-box at once,
 eight months after his previous experience with it. For here was some sort of
 registration of a solution.</p>

         </title>
         <body>
            <p>Two chimpanzees in the Dublin Zoo were often to be seen washing the two
 shelves of their cupboard and "wringing" the wet cloth in the
 approved fashion. It was like a caricature of a washerwoman, and someone
 said, "What mimics they are!" Now we do not know whether that was
 or was not the case with the chimpanzees, but the majority of the experiments
 that have been made do not lead us to attach to imitation so much importance
 as is usually given to it by the popular interpreter. There are instances
 where a monkey that had given up a puzzle in despair returned to it when it
 had seen its neighbour succeed, but most of the experiments suggested that
 the creature has to find out for itself. Even with such a simple problem as
 drawing food near with a stick, it often seems of little use to show the
 monkey how it is done. Placing a bit of food outside his
 monkey's<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
 238]</ph> cage, Professor Holmes "poked it about with the stick so
 as to give her a suggestion of how the stick might be employed to move the
 food within reach, but although the act was repeated many times Lizzie never
 showed the least inclination to use the stick to her advantage." Perhaps
 the idea of a "tool" is beyond the Bonnet Monkey, yet here again we
 must be cautious, for Professor L. T. Hobhouse had a monkey of the same
 macaque genus which learned in the course of time to use a crooked stick with
 great effect.</p>

         <body>
            <p>Perhaps the cleverest monkey as yet studied was a performing chimpanzee
 called Peter, which has been generally described by Dr. Lightner Witmer.
 Peter could skate and cycle, thread needles and untie knots, smoke a
 cigarette and string beads, screw in nails and unlock locks. But what Peter
 was thinking about all the time it was hard to guess, and there is very
 little evidence to suggest that his rapid power of putting two and two
 together ever rose above a sort of concrete mental experimenting, which Dr.
 Romanes used to call perceptual inference. Without supposing that there are
 hard-and-fast boundary lines, we cannot avoid the general conclusion that,
 while monkeys are often intelligent, they seldom, if ever, show even hints of
 reason, i.e. of working or playing with general ideas. That remains Man's
 prerogative.</p>

            <p>In mammals like otters, foxes, stoats, hares, and elephants, what a

 of a stream with currents at different levels. Lowest there are the <i>basal

 Then there are the <i>primary emotions</i>, such as fear of hereditary
 enemies and maternal affection for offspring. Above these are <i>instinctive

 learn<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg

 meaning. The mind of the higher animal is in some respects like a child's
 mind, in having little in the way of clear-cut ideas, in showing no reason in
 the strict sense, and in its extraordinary educability, but it differs from
 the child's mind entirely in the sure effectiveness of a certain
 repertory of responses. It is efficient to a degree.</p>

         <body>
            <p>Man's brain is more complicated than that of the higher
 apes—gorilla, orang, and chimpanzee—and it is relatively larger.
 But the improvements in structure do not seem in themselves sufficient to
 account for man's great advance in intelligence. The rill of inner life
 has become a swift stream, sometimes a rushing torrent. Besides perceptual
 inference or <i>Intelligence</i>—a sort of picture-logic, which some
 animals likewise have—there is conceptual inference—or
 <i>Reason</i>—an internal experimenting with general ideas. Even the
 cleverest animals, it would seem, do not get much beyond playing with
 "particulars"; man plays an internal game of chess with
 "universals." Intelligent behaviour may go a long way with mental
 images; rational conduct demands general ideas. It may be, however, that
 "percepts" and "concepts" differ rather in degree than in
 kind, and that the passage from one to the other meant a higher power of
 forming associations. A clever dog has probably a generalised percept of man,
 as distinguished from a memory-image of the particular men it has known, but
 man alone has the concept Man,<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 240]</ph> or Mankind, or Humanity. Experimenting with
 concepts or general ideas is what we call Reason.</p>
            <p>Here, of course, we get into deep waters, and perhaps it is wisest not to
 attempt too much. So we shall content ourselves here with pointing out that
 Man's advance in intelligence and from intelligence to reason is closely
 wrapped up with his power of speech. What animals began—a small
 vocabulary—he has carried to high perfection. But what is distinctive
 is not the vocabulary so much as the habit of making sentences, of expressing
 judgments in a way which admitted of communication between mind and mind. The
 multiplication of words meant much, the use of words as symbols of general
 ideas meant even more, for it meant the possibility of playing the internal
 game of thinking; but perhaps the most important advance of all was the means
 of comparing notes with neighbours, of corroborating individual experience by
 social intercourse. With words, also, it became easier to enregister outside
 himself the gains of the past. It is not without significance that the Greek
 Logos, which may be translated "the word," may also be translated
 Mind.</p>

         <body>
            <p>When we take a survey of animal behaviour we see a long inclined plane.
 The outer world provokes simple creatures to answer back; simple creatures
 act experimentally on their surroundings. From the beginning this twofold
 process has been going on, receiving stimuli from the environment and acting
 upon the environment, and according to the efficiency of the reactions and
 actions living creatures have been sifted for millions of years. One main
 line of advance has been opening new gateways of knowledge—the senses,
 which are far more than five in number. The other main line of advance has
 been in most general terms, experimenting or testing, probing and proving,
 trying one key after another till a door is unlocked. There is<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 241]</ph> progress in
 multiplying the gateways of knowledge and making them more discriminating,
 and there is progress in making the modes of experimenting more wide-awake,
 more controlled, and more resolute. But behind both of these is the
 characteristically vital power of enregistering within the organism the
 lessons of the past. In the life of the individual these enregistrations are
 illustrated by memories and habituations and habits; in the life of the race
 they are illustrated by reflex actions and instinctive capacities.</p>

         <body>
            <p>We must not shirk the very difficult question of the relation between the
 bodily and the mental side of behaviour.</p>
            <p>(<i>a</i>) Some great thinkers have taught that the mind is a reality by
 itself which plays upon the instrument of the brain and body. As the
 instrument gets worn and dusty the playing is not so good as it once was, but
 the player is still himself. This theory of the essential independence of the
 mind is a very beautiful one, but those who like it when applied to
 themselves are not always so fond of it when it is applied to other
 intelligent creatures like rooks and elephants. It may be, however, that
 there is a gradual emancipation of the mind which has gone furthest in Man
 and is still progressing.</p>
            <p>(<i>b</i>) Some other thinkers have taught that the inner life of thought
 and feeling is only, as it were, an echo of the really important
 activity—that of the body and brain. Ideas are just foam-bells on the
 hurrying streams and circling eddies of matter and energy that make up our
 physiological life. To most of us this theory is impossible, because we are
 quite sure that ideas and feelings and purposes, which cannot be translated
 into matter and motion, are the clearest realities in our experience, and
 that they count for good and ill all through our life. They are more than the
 tickings of the clock; they make the wheels go round.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg 242]</ph>
            </p>
            <p>(<i>c</i>) There are others who think that the most scientific position is
 simply to recognise both the bodily and the mental activities as equally
 important, and so closely interwoven that they cannot be separated. Perhaps
 they are just the outer and the inner aspects of one reality—the life
 of the creature. Perhaps they are like the concave and convex curves of a
 dome, like the two sides of a shield. Perhaps the life of the organism is
 always a unity, at one time appearing more conspicuously as Mind-body, at
 another time as Body-mind. The most important fact is that neither aspect can
 be left out. By no jugglery with words can we get Mind out of Matter and
 Motion. And since we are in ourselves quite sure of our Mind, we are probably
 safe in saying that in the beginning was Mind. This is in accordance with
 Aristotle's saying that there is nothing in the end which was not also in
 kind present in the beginning—whatever we mean by beginning.</p>

            <p>What has led to the truly wonderful result which we admire in a creature
 like a dog or an otter, a horse or a hare? In general, we may say, just two
 main processes—(1) testing all things, and (2) holding fast that which
 is good. New departures occur and these are tested for what they are worth.
 Idiosyncrasies crop up and they are sifted. New cards come mysteriously from
 within into the creature's hand, and they are played—for better or
 for worse. So by new variations and their sifting, by experimenting and
 enregistering the results, the mind has gradually evolved and will continue
 to evolve.<ph outputclass="pagenum">[Pg
