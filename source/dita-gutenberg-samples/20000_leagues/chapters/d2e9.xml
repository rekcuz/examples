      <title>VERNE'S TITLE</title>
    <p>The French title of this novel is <i>Vingt mille lieues sous les
      mers</i>. This is accurately translated as Twenty Thousand Leagues
      Under the SEAS&#x2014;rather than the SEA, as with many English
      editions. Verne's novel features a tour of the major oceans, and
      the term Leagues in its title is used as a measure not of depth but
      distance. Ed.</p>
