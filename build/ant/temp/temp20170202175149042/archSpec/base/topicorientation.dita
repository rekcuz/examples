                            fact. Recipes, encyclopedia entries, car repair procedures--all serve up
                            a uniquely focused unit of information. The topic contains everything

                            context free, meaning that it can be inserted into a new document
                            without revision of its content. A context-free topic avoids
                            transitional text. Phrases like "As we considered earlier ..." or "Now
                            that you have completed the initial step ..." make little sense if a
                            topic is reused in a new context in which the relationships are
                            different or no longer exist. A well-designed topic reads appropriately
                            in any new context because the text does not refer the reader outside
                            the topic.</p>

                            navigation. Internal links lead a reader through a sequence of choices
                            as he or she navigates through a website. DITA supports the separation
                            of navigation from content by assembling independent topics into DITA
                            maps. Nonetheless, writers may want to provide links within a topic to
                            additional topics or external resources. DITA does not prohibit such
                            linking within individual topics. The DITA relationship table enables
                            links between topics and to external content. Since it is defined in the
                            DITA map, it is managed independently of the topic content.</p>

                            Links from within a topic to additional topics or external resources
                            should be avoided because they limit the reusability of the topic. To
                            link from a term or keyword to its definition, use the DITA keyref
                            facility to avoid creating topic-to-topic dependencies that are
